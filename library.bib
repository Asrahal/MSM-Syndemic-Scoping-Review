In addition, a transinclusive environment should be created to reduce the likelihood of transgender-related discrimination.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) constitute a risk group for sexual transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. Despite counselling interventions, risk behaviour remains high. Syndemic theory holds that psychosocial problems often co-occur, interact and mutually reinforce each other, thereby increasing high risk behaviours and co-occurring diseases. Therefore, if co-occurring psychosocial problems were assessed and treated simultaneously, this might decrease high risk behaviour and disease. METHOD: An open label randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 150 MSM with high risk behaviour recruited from the STI clinic of Amsterdam. Inclusion criteria are: HIV negative MSM with two STI and/or PEP treatment in the last 24~months, or HIV positive MSM with one STI in the last 24~months. All participants get questionnaires on the following syndemic domains: ADHD, depression, anxiety disorder, alexithymia and sex- and drug addiction. Participants in the control group receive standard care: STI screenings every three months and motivational interviewing based counselling. Participants in the experimental group receive standard care plus feedback based on the results of the questionnaires. All participants can be referred to co-located mental health or addiction services. The primary outcome is help seeking behaviour for mental health problems and/or drug use problems. The secondary outcomes are STI incidence and changes in sexual risk behaviour (i.e. condom use, number of anal sex partners, drug use during sex). DISCUSSION: This study will provide information on syndemic domains among MSM who show high risk behaviour and on the effect of screening and referral on help seeking behaviour and health (behaviour) outcomes.

Syndemic theory holds that psychosocial issues co-occur and interact, and thus increase sexual risk behaviour. Psychosocial issue identification, referral and management might reduce risk behaviour., METHODS: In the syndemic-based intervention study, an open-label randomised controlled trial, MSM were enrolled at the STI outpatient clinic of the Public Health Service of Amsterdam. We screened participants using validated questionnaires on the following problem domains: alcohol and substance use, sexual compulsivity, anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, alexithymia, intimate partner violence and childhood sexual abuse. Individuals were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either tailored, face-to-face feedback and help-seeking advice on mental health screening, or no feedback and no help-seeking advice. Participants were followed trimonthly for a year. The primary outcomes were self-reported and confirmed help-seeking behaviour., RESULTS: We included 155 MSM: 76 in the intervention group and 79 in the control group. At inclusion, 128 participants (83.1\%) scored positive in at least one problem domain. We found no significant differences in self-reported or confirmed help-seeking behaviour between the intervention and the control group: 41\% vs 29\% (p=0.14) and 28\% vs 22\% (p=0.44), respectively. There were also no differences in STI incidence and condomless anal sex acts between the two groups., CONCLUSION: Screening showed high prevalence of problems related to mental health and substance use, while tailored feedback, advice and referral did not significantly increase help-seeking behaviour. Other interventions are needed to tackle the high burden of mental disorders among MSM., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02859935. Copyright \textcopyright{} Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Syndemic theory holds that psychosocial problems often co-occur, interact and mutually reinforce each other, thereby increasing risk behavior. We studied the prevalence of psychosocial problems and whether raising awareness of these psychosocial problems increases help seeking behavior. Methods An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted among MSM with high risk behavior recruited from the STI clinic of Amsterdam (NCT02859935). Inclusion criteria were: either two STI or PEP treatment for HIV negative MSM or one STI for HIV positive MSM in the last 24 months. The following syndemic domains were explored: alcohol, drugs and sex addiction (AUDIT, DUDIT, SCS), anxiety disorder(HADS), depression(HADS), childhood sexual abuse and partner violence. Participants received trimonthly standard STI care for one year. Additionally, the intervention group received face-to-face feedback on syndemic questionnaires. Results Between September 2016 and August 2017 155 MSM were included. Median age was 43(IQR [34-51]), and 103/ 155(66\%) were HIV positive. At baseline, 37/155(24\%) tested positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea or syphilis, 1/52(2\%) for HIV, 138/148(93\%) reported using drugs during sex in the preceding 3 months, and 51/155(33\%) self-reported help seeking behavior. In total, 114/155(75\%) scored positive for at least 1 questionnaire: 47/154(31\%) for alcohol use disorder, 76/154(49\%) for drug use disorder, 28/154(18\%) for sexual compulsivity, 47/154(30\%) for anxiety disorder, 26/154(17\%) for depression, 17/154(11\%) for sexual abuse and 12/154(8\%) for partner violence. Between the intervention and control group, we found no significant difference in self-reported help seeking behavior (35\% vs 24\% p=0.168), or in number of partners(13 IQR[5.5-30] vs 8.5 IQR[5-15] respectively, p=0.128). Conclusion Psychosocial and addiction related problems are alarmingly high in high risk MSM, and a syndemic approach seems necessary. Preliminary results indicate that our intervention did not increase self-reported help seeking behavior. Data collection on confirmed help seeking is ongoing.},

This paper seeks to place these findings in a larger social context marked by neoliberalism to provide some insights into the arenas of vulnerability to risk. These arenas are shaped by shifts in the environing political economy which generate subjectivities concordant with the pressures of the neoliberal turn to increasing marketization, individualization, and responsibilization. These pressures create cultures of expectation that accentuate particular trends defining success, masculinity, and risk in contemporary societies. In other words, the "risk factors," identified in the now voluminous research literature on HIV, cumulate in particular social locations that, at least in part, articulate with masculine gender performance in marketplaces. These intersections affect the expression of sex between men and vulnerabilities to risk, providing an alternative understanding to the deficit models currently in health science research.

Risk practices fell into three high-risk modes: active and frequent engagement in condomless sex; unassertive deferment to a partner's initiation of condomless sex; and episodic risk combined with a risk reduction strategy. Three low risk modes were also identified: no recent condomlessness but multiple risk history in interview; a trajectory over time from high to low risk; and consistent low risk practice. These different modes of syndemic experience and risk management may have implications for identification of the effective HIV prevention tools that work best for different sets of men.},

Interviews with 40 men identified branching pathways from home environments into schools that either offer refuge or a regime of gender discipline and bullying. Some found escape routes from hostile environments in worlds of books, pop culture, or internet chat. In adolescence, one set of men identified the development of sexual relationships with older men as a lifeline that brought a measure of emotional growth.

  abstract = {Men who have sex with men (MSM) in Tanzania are not only disproportionately affected by HIV but also exposed to psychosocial health problems. Tanzanian MSM, like those in other resource-constrained and rights-challenged countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), are confronted with HIV-related adversities contextualized by rights-challenged and pervasively homophobic environments. These men are also socially marginalized---systematically excluded from HIV interventions and denied access to health services---in a way that threatens the possibility of achieving an AIDS-free generation in Tanzania. However, the protective and resilience factors that these men employ to survive these HIV-related adversities remain undermined. First data on demographic characteristics, HIV prevalence and risks among 300 Tanzanian MSM residing in Dar es Salaam and Tanga were used to examine whether there were additive interactions between five psychosocial health problems coined SAVID (substance abuse, adolescent sexual abuse, violence, internalized homonegativity and depression), that increased the odd of HIV seropositivity and HIV risk. The data also offered opportunity to explore potential resilience factors that buffered effects of SAVID on HIV seropositivity and risk among Tanzanian MSM. This is the first study of SSA that extended the utility of syndemic theory to offer theoretically sound understanding of HIV dynamics among MSM in Tanzania. It is also the first study from sub-Saharan Africa that explored the utility of resilience theory to identify potential resilience factors that conferred buffering effects on HIV infection and risks among Tanzanian MSM. Literature review provided empirical evidence to support HIV disparity, existence of psychosocial health problems and their associations with HIV seropositivity and risk among SSA MSM. Previous studies were also reviewed to identify existing socio-culturally related coping strategies employed by SSA MSM to survive in hostile environment as a way of reinforcing strength-based approach to HIV intervention targeting SSA MSM. Using a syndemic framework, analyses were carried out to examine the additive or synergistic effects of SAVID on HIV seroprevalence and risk among Tanzanian MSM. From the perspective of resilience theory, further analyses were carried to determine potential resilience factors that buffer effects of SAVID on HIV infections and risks in the sample of Tanzanian MSM. Outcomes of the analyses revealed significant additive effects of SAVID on HIV infection and risks. While controlling for other demographic factors, SAVID syndemic variable was observed to increase the odds of HIV seropositivity and risks among Tanzanian MSM. While moderating effects analyses revealed formal social visibility among acquaintances buffering the impact of SAVID on HIV infection, early age (less than 15) at awareness of sexual orientation, formal social visibility among acquaintances and functional support directly conferred protection on HIV and not on HIV risk. Findings from this study are of great relevance in public health discourse on strength-based approach to HIV prevention program strategically needed to promote the health of socially marginalized group like Tanzanian MSM. Results from this study also present syndemic framework as a novel approach to understand dynamics of HIV infection and risks among marginalized MSM groups living in homophobic environment. The findings also signify the importance of harnessing naturally-occurring resilience factors, through strength-based HIV preventive efforts as a way of designing meaningful intervention for SSA MSM.

In response to this concentrated epidemic, the Government of Zanzibar, international and local non-profit organisations have focused their prevention activities on these marginal populations. Although these efforts are beneficial in terms of disseminating information about HIV/AIDS and referring clients to health clinics, they fail to address how the socio-economic status of these groups places them at a greater risk for contracting and dying from the virus. Furthermore, there is an absence of qualitative research on these populations which is needed to understand the challenges these groups face and to improve the effectiveness of interventions. Through interviews with employees of government agencies and non-profit organisations, medical professionals, vulnerable populations and HIV/AIDS patients, this paper used a political economy of health and syndemic framework to examine how local realities inform and challenge HIV/AIDS programmes in Zanzibar.},

  abstract = {Background: Several outbreaks of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) were recently documented among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Europe. We investigated the HAV incidence among MSM in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; and HAV seroprevalence and HAV vaccination decision among MSM visiting the Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinic in Amsterdam. Methods: Using surveillance data from 1992 to 2017 of MSM with acute HAV in Amsterdam, we estimated the incidence by calendar year and age. We explored HAV seroprevalence by calendar year and age, determinants for HAV seropositivity, and opting-in/out for HAV vaccination using data collected among MSM that visited the STI clinic between 2006 and 2017 and were included in a nationwide Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination programme. Offering HAV vaccination at the STI clinic differed over three consecutive periods: not offered, offered for free, or offered for 75 euros. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore determinants. Results: HAV incidence increased in 2016/17 after 4 years of absence and peaked in MSM around 35 years of age. Among MSM visiting the STI clinic, HAV seroprevalence was 37\% (95\%CI = 35\textendash 40\%), which was constant over the period 2006\textendash 2017, and increased with age (p {$<$} 0.001). Determinants for HAV seropositivity in multivariable analysis were: older age (p {$<$} 0.001), originating from an HAV endemic country (p {$<$} 0.001), and being HBV seropositive (p = 0.001). MSM opted-in more frequently when HAV vaccination was offered for free versus paid (89\% versus 11\%, respectively; p {$<$} 0.001). Younger MSM were less inclined to vaccinate when payment was required (p = 0.010). Post-hoc analyses showed that 98\% versus 46\% of MSM visiting the Amsterdam STI clinic would be protected against HAV infection if HAV vaccination was offered for free or for 75 euros, respectively. Conclusions: The MSM population of Amsterdam is vulnerable to a new HAV outbreak. We strongly recommend that MSM have access to free hepatitis A vaccination. \'O 2019 The Authors.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Objectives: HIV prevalence among sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals in South Africa is among the highest in the world; however, SGM migrants, an especially vulnerable subgroup of both the SGM and migrant populations, have frequently been overlooked in the country's robust public health response. This qualitative study, guided by syndemics theory, explored the processes by which SGM migrants in South Africa are exposed to HIV risk and those that may reduce this risk. Design: We conducted 6 focus groups with a total of 30 SGM migrants living in Cape Town. Participants were men who have sex with men, women who have sex with women, and transgender women. Transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory. Results: Participants identified a number of interrelated factors (insecure immigration status, financial and housing instability, food insecurity, stigma and discrimination, and lack of social support) contributing to HIV risk. While some took PrEP or HIV medication, adherence could be affected by structural and psychosocial barriers. Conclusion: Interventions that respond to the syndemic impacts on HIV outcomes are needed to reduce disease burden among SGM migrants in South Africa.

  abstract = {Background or Objectives: Worldwide, men who have sex with men (MSM) and Transgender persons are vulnerable to psychosocial factors associated with high risk for HIV, and suffer disproportionately high rates of HIV/AIDS. In the United States (US), the House Ball Community (HBC) is a social network comprised predominantly of Black and Hispanic MSM and Transgender persons who reside in communal settings. This study explores Western New York HBC leaders' perceptions of HIV in their communities and their knowledge of HIV prevention strategies, including HIV vaccine trials., Methods: The project was conducted using an exploratory approach based on the principles of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methods. An HIV behavioral risk assessment provided descriptive data, while qualitative measures explored psychosocial and behavioral factors., Results: Behavioral assessments indicated high levels of risky sexual behaviors and experiences of violence. Interviews with 14 HBC leaders revealed that knowledge of HIV and local HIV vaccines trials was limited. Barriers to HIV knowledge included fear of peer judgment, having inaccurate information, and lack of formal education. Experiencing violence was identified as barrier to positive health behavior. Nevertheless, the HBC was described as a safe and creative space for marginalized MSM and Transgender youth., Conclusion and Global Health Implications: Findings suggest that the interrelation between health problems and social context amplify HIV risk in the HBC. The organizational structure and resources of the HBC, and MSM/Transgender communities worldwide can be instrumental in informing interventions to address HIV-related risk behaviors and create appropriate recruitment tools to ensure their representation in HIV research.

  abstract = {T he common cold is an acute, self-limiting viral infection of the upper respiratory tract involving the nose, sinuses, pharynx and larynx. The virus is spread by hand contact with secretions from an infected person (direct or indirect) or aerosol of the secretions and virus. 1 The incubation period varies but is just under two days for rhinovirus. 2 Symptoms, which generally relate to the infected mucosa, typically peak at 1-3 days and last 7-10 days, although they occasionally persist for three weeks. 1,3-5 They include sore throat, rhinitis, rhinorrhea, cough and malaise. 1,4 The severity and type of symptoms will vary among individuals and with different infective agents. For example , fever is common in children but rare and mild in adults. 1 The incidence of the common cold declines with age. 5-7 Children under two years have about six infections a year, adults two to three and older people about one per year. 5-9 Stress 10 and poor sleep 11 may increase the risk of the common cold among adults, whereas attendance at a daycare centre 12 in creases the risk among preschool children. Rhinovirus accounts for 24\%-52\% of clinical cases or 52\%-76\% of infections with an identified pathogen. 6-8,13 No pathogen is identified in 31\%-57\% of upper respiratory tract infections, 8,13 likely because of a host of reasons, including poor collection technique, low pathogen count due to sampling late in the illness, or previously unidentified agents. 1 Only about 5\% of clinically diagnosed cases were found to have bacterial infection (with or without viral co-infection). 13 Although self-limiting, the common cold is highly prevalent and may be debilitating. It causes declines in function and productivity at work 14,15 and may affect other activities such as driving. 16 Its impact on society and health care is large. Of individuals with an upper respiratory tract infection, 7\%-17\% of adults 17,18 and 33\% of children 17 visit a physician. Upper respiratory tract infections result in an estimated increase of 12.5\% in patient visits per month during cold and flu season. 19 In the United States, direct medical costs related to the common cold (physician visits, secondary infections and medications) were an estimated \$17 billion a year in 1997. 17 Indirect costs owing to missed work because of illness or caring for an ill child were an estimated \$25 billion a year. 17 We review the evidence underpinning preventive and treatment interventions for the common cold. We do not explore the proposed biologic mechanisms for the different products, because most are not substantiated and generally represent more supposition than science. The quality of the evidence was frequently poor, with a moderate to high risk of bias. Although preventive interventions have somewhat discrete outcomes (presence of an upper respiratory tract infection), interpretation of the evidence for treatment of the common cold is challenged by the complexity of outcome reporting. The evidence used in this review is described in Box 1.},

Objective: We aimed to compare add-on cyproterone acetate versus spironolactone in lowering endogenous testosterone concentrations in transfeminine individuals. Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: We analysed 114 transfeminine individuals who had been on oestradiol therapy for {$>$}6 months in two gender clinics in Melbourne, Australia. Total testosterone concentrations were compared between three groups; oestradiol alone (n\,=\,21), oestradiol plus cyproterone acetate (n\,=\,21) and oestradiol plus spironolactone (n\,=\,38). Secondary outcomes included serum oestradiol concentration, oestradiol valerate dose, blood pressure, serum potassium, urea and creatinine. Results: Median age was 27.0 years (22.5\textendash 45.1) and median duration of hormone therapy was 1.5 years (0.9\textendash 2.6), which was not different between groups. On univariate analysis, the cyproterone group had significantly lower total testosterone concentrations (0.8\,nmol/L (0.6\textendash 1.20)) compared with the spironolactone group (2.0\,nmol/L (0.9\textendash 9.4), P\,=\,0.037) and oestradiol alone group (10.5\,nmol/L (4.9\textendash 17.2), P\,{$<$}\,0.001), which remained significant (P\,=\,0.005) after adjustments for oestradiol concentration, dose and age. Serum urea was higher in the spironolactone group compared with the cyproterone group. No differences were observed in total daily oestradiol dose, blood pressure, serum oestradiol, potassium or creatinine. Conclusions: The cyproterone group achieved serum total testosterone concentrations in the female reference range. As spironolactone may cause feminisation without inhibition of steroidogenesis, it is unclear which anti-androgen is more effective at feminisation. Further prospective studies are required.},

  abstract = {Importance Worldwide, 47 million people live with dementia and, by 2050, the number is expected to increase to 131 million. Observations Dementia is an acquired loss of cognition in multiple cognitive domains sufficiently severe to affect social or occupational function. In the United States, Alzheimer disease, one cause of dementia, affects 5.8 million people. Dementia is commonly associated with more than 1 neuropathology, usually Alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular pathology. Diagnosing dementia requires a history evaluating for cognitive decline and impairment in daily activities, with corroboration from a close friend or family member, in addition to a thorough mental status examination by a clinician to delineate impairments in memory, language, attention, visuospatial cognition such as spatial orientation, executive function, and mood. Brief cognitive impairment screening questionnaires can assist in initiating and organizing the cognitive assessment. However, if the assessment is inconclusive (eg, symptoms present, but normal examination findings), neuropsychological testing can help determine whether dementia is present. Physical examination may help identify the etiology of dementia. For example, focal neurologic abnormalities suggest stroke. Brain neuroimaging may demonstrate structural changes including, but not limited to, focal atrophy, infarcts, and tumor, that may not be identified on physical examination. Additional evaluation with cerebrospinal fluid assays or genetic testing may be considered in atypical dementia cases, such as age of onset younger than 65 years, rapid symptom onset, and/or impairment in multiple cognitive domains but not episodic memory. For treatment, patients may benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches, including cognitively engaging activities such as reading, physical exercise such as walking, and socialization such as family gatherings. Pharmacologic approaches can provide modest symptomatic relief. For Alzheimer disease, this includes an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor such as donepezil for mild to severe dementia, and memantine (used alone or as an add-on therapy) for moderate to severe dementia. Rivastigmine can be used to treat symptomatic Parkinson disease dementia. Conclusions and Relevance Alzheimer disease currently affects 5.8 million persons in the United States and is a common cause of dementia, which is usually accompanied by other neuropathology, often cerebrovascular disease such as brain infarcts. Causes of dementia can be diagnosed by medical history, cognitive and physical examination, laboratory testing, and brain imaging. Management should include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches, although efficacy of available treatments remains limited.},

The term reflects a deliberate attempt to weaponise scientific-sounding language to dismiss mounting empirical evidence of the benefits of transition. This article offers an introduction to the theory of ROGD and its history, presents a detailed critique of the empirical and theoretical claims associated with the theory, and highlights structural concerns with the ROGD discourse. The article argues that claims associated with ROGD, including assertions of declining mental health and degrading familial relationships following coming out, are best explained by the leading ROGD study's recruitment of parents from transantagonistic websites against a background of growing visibility and social acceptance of trans people. ROGD theory is best understood as an attempt to circumvent existing research demonstrating the importance of gender affirmation, relying on scientific-sounding language to achieve respectability.},

We assessed mortality rates in transsexual subjects receiving long-term cross-sex hormones. Design: A cohort study with a median follow-up of 18.5 years at a university gender clinic. Methods: Mortality data and the standardized mortality rate were compared with the general population in 966 male-to-female (MtF) and 365 female-to-male (FtM) transsexuals, who started cross-sex hormones before July 1, 1997. Follow-up was at least 1 year. MtF transsexuals received treatment with different high-dose estrogen regimens and cyproterone acetate 100 mg/day. FtM transsexuals received parenteral/oral testosterone esters or testosterone gel. After surgical sex reassignment, hormonal treatment was continued with lower doses. Results: In the MtF group, total mortality was 51\% higher than in the general population, mainly from increased mortality rates due to suicide, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cardiovascular disease, drug abuse, and unknown cause. No increase was observed in total cancer mortality, but lung and hematological cancer mortality rates were elevated. Current, but not past ethinyl estradiol use was associated with an independent threefold increased risk of cardiovascular death. In FtM transsexuals, total mortality and cause-specific mortality were not significantly different from those of the general population. Conclusions: The increased mortality in hormone-treated MtF transsexuals was mainly due to non-hormone-related causes, but ethinyl estradiol may increase the risk of cardiovascular death. In the FtM transsexuals, use of testosterone in doses used for hypogonadal men seemed safe.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To describe patterns of purging and binge eating from early through late adolescence in female and male youth across a range of sexual orientations. Methods: Using data from the prospective Growing Up Today Study, a large cohort of U.S. youth, we investigated trends in past-year self-reports of purging (ever vomit or use laxatives for weight control) and binge eating at least monthly. The analytic sample included 57,668 observations from repeated measures gathered from 13,795 youth aged 12-23 years providing information collected by self-administered questionnaires from six waves of data collection. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine sexual orientation group (heterosexual, "mostly heterosexual," bisexual, and lesbian/gay) differences in purging and binge eating throughout adolescence, with same-gender heterosexuals as the referent group and controlling for age and race/ethnicity. Results: Throughout adolescence, in most cases, sexual orientation group differences were evident at the youngest ages and persisted through adolescence. Among females and compared with heterosexuals, "mostly heterosexuals," bisexuals, and lesbians were more likely to report binge eating, but only "mostly heterosexuals" and bisexuals were also more likely to report purging. Among males, all three sexual orientation subgroups were more likely than heterosexual males to report both binge eating and purging. Within each orientation subgroup, females generally reported higher prevalence of purging and binge eating than did males. Conclusions: Clinicians need to be alert to the risk of eating disordered behaviors in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and "mostly heterosexual" adolescents of both genders to better evaluate these youth and refer them for treatment. ?? 2009 Society for Adolescent Medicine.},

Predetermined inclusion criteria were selected. Thirty quantitative studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. Discriminative behaviors experienced by SGM individuals were stigma, denial or refusal of health care, and verbal or physical abuse. Knowledge and educational levels, beliefs, and religion of health care providers affected their attitudes toward SGM patients and their homophobia level. These findings revealed that health care providers needed more education about SGM issues, and SGM-friendly policies should be created for improving health care for SGM individuals.},

Participants' perceptions of their parents' reactions, age at coming out, gender, parental political orientation and religiosity, family functioning, and internalized sexual stigma were assessed in 150 Italian homosexual adolescents. Findings confirm that negative parental reactions are connected to poor family functioning and strong beliefs in traditional values. Path analysis results identified that negative reaction to coming out mediates the effect between a more rigid family functioning and internalized sexual stigma. Implications for clinical and social fields are discussed.},

The present study investigated the negative parental reaction to the disclosure of same-sex attraction and the differences between maternal and paternal responses, as reported by their homosexual daughters and sons. Participants' perceptions of their parents' reactions (evaluated through the Perceived Parental Reactions Scale, PPRS), age at CO, gender, parental political orientation, and religiosity involvement, the family functioning (assessed through the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales), were assessed in 164 Italian gay and lesbian young adults. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relation between family functioning and parental reaction to CO. The paired sample t test was used to compare mothers and fathers' scores on the PPRS. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to analyze the relevance of each variable. No differences were found between mothers and fathers in their reaction to the dis-closure. The analysis showed that a negative reaction to CO was predicted by parents' right-wing political conser-vatism, strong religious beliefs, and higher scores in the scales Rigid and Enmeshed. Findings confirm that a neg-ative parental reaction is the result of poor family resources to face a stressful situation and a strong belief in traditional values. These results have important implications in both clinical and social fields.},

In 2015 this resulted in the status report Tina and Slamming: MSM, Crystal Meth Use and Intravenous Drug Use in a Sexual Context. Following the publication of this report Mainline foundation has been offering harm-reduction intervention for MSM and promoting the development of a continuum of care by building networks, training professionals and investing in advocacy. In our view, a continuum of care means the availability of a sufficient level of qualitative and effective preventive interventions, harm reduction services and treatment facilities that are connected, can track and intervene in the 'lifecycle' of individual drug use, and are easily accessible by the target group. This case study describes the various interventions of Mainline foundation, that make up their continuum of care approach concerning chemsex issues.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous systematic reviews have identified a high prevalence of HIV infection in transgender women in the USA and in those who sell sex (compared with both female and male sex workers). However, little is known about the burden of HIV infection in transgender women worldwide. We aimed to better assess the relative HIV burden in all transgender women worldwide. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that assessed HIV infection burdens in transgender women that were published between Jan 1, 2000, and Nov 30, 2011. Meta-analysis was completed with the Mantel-Haenszel method, and random-effects modelling was used to compare HIV burdens in transgender women with that in adults in the countries for which data were available. Findings: Data were only available for countries with male-predominant HIV epidemics, which included the USA, six Asia-Pacific countries, five in Latin America, and three in Europe. The pooled HIV prevalence was 19{$\cdot$}1\% (95\% CI 17{$\cdot$}4-20{$\cdot$}7) in 11 066 transgender women worldwide. In 7197 transgender women sampled in ten low-income and middle-income countries, HIV prevalence was 17{$\cdot$}7\% (95\% CI 15{$\cdot$}6-19{$\cdot$}8). In 3869 transgender women sampled in five high-income countries, HIV prevalence was 21{$\cdot$}6\% (95\% CI 18{$\cdot$}8-24{$\cdot$}3). The odds ratio for being infected with HIV in transgender women compared with all adults of reproductive age across the 15 countries was 48{$\cdot$}8 (95\% CI 21{$\cdot$}2-76{$\cdot$}3) and did not differ for those in low-income and middle-income countries compared with those in high-income countries. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that transgender women are a very high burden population for HIV and are in urgent need of prevention, treatment, and care services. The meta-analysis showed remarkable consistency and severity of the HIV disease burden among transgender women.

We note the special situation of multiple category prevalence, and propose solutions to the problems that arise. We describe the implementation of these methods in the MetaXL software, and present a simulation study and the example of multiple sclerosis from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 project. We conclude that the double arcsine transformation is preferred over the logit, and that the MetaXL implementation of multiple category prevalence is an improvement in the methodology of the meta-analysis of prevalence.},

The aims of this study were to measure the prevalence of recreational drug use among MSM in a national sample, and to identify sub-groups of MSM who may benefit from targeted preventive interventions. Methods: The MSM Internet Survey Ireland (MISI) 2015 was a community-recruited, nationally-promoted, self-completed online survey for MSM. MISI 2015 included standardised questions on recreational drugs, poppers, and drugs associated with chemsex (i.e. crystal methamphetamine, GBL/GHB, mephedrone, ketamine). Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with use of these substances. Results: In the previous year, 36\% of MSM used recreational drugs, 33\% used poppers, and 7\% used drugs associated with chemsex. Five percent were diagnosed HIV-positive. Recreational drug users were significantly younger than non-users (median = 27 vs. 32 years; p {$<$} 0.001); popper users were significantly older than non-users (median = 34 vs. 28 years; p {$<$} 0.001). The odds of recreational drug use were higher among MSM diagnosed HIV-positive (vs. never tested; AOR 2.27, 95\%CI 1.39\textendash 3.70). Use of poppers, and use of drugs associated with chemsex, were also higher among MSM diagnosed HIV-positive (vs. never tested; AOR 3.77, 95\%CI 2.41\textendash 5.90, and AOR 5.87, 95\%CI 3.08\textendash 11.18 respectively). Conclusions: The prevalence of recreational drug use is higher among MSM than in the general population in Ireland, and it is particularly high among MSM diagnosed HIV-positive. Targeted harm reduction messages and preventive interventions are warranted to complement population-based approaches to reducing drug use in this population.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Syndemic theory posits that co-occurring problems (e.g., substance use, depression, and trauma) synergistically increase HIV risk in men who have sex with men (MSM). However, most investigations have assessed these problems additively using self-report. METHOD: In a sample of HIV-negative MSM with trauma histories (n = 290), we test bivariate relationships between four clinical diagnoses (substance use disorder [SUD]); major depressive disorder [MDD], posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], and anxiety disorders) and their additive and interactive effects on three health indicators (i.e., high-risk sex, visiting the emergency room [ER], and sexually transmitted infections [STIs]). RESULTS: We found significant bivariate relationships between SUD and MDD ({$\chi^2$} = 4.85, p = .028) and between PTSD and MDD ({$\chi^2$} = 35.38, p = .028, p {$<$} .001) but did not find a significant relationship between SUD and PTSD ({$\chi^2$} = 3.64, p = .056). Number of diagnoses were associated with episodes of high-risk sex (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.14, 95\% CI [1.03, 1.26], p = .009) and visiting the ER (odds ratio = 1.27; 95\% CI [1.01, 1.60], p = .040) but not with STIs. No interactions were found between diagnoses and health-related indicators. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate additive effects of clinical diagnoses on risk behavior and health care utilization among MSM with developmental trauma histories. Results indicate the need to prioritize empirically supported treatments for SUD and MDD, in addition to trauma treatment, for this population.

The co-occurrence of multiple outcomes has rarely been studied., METHODS: Data were collected from 405 bisexuals using respondent-driven sampling. Weighted analyses were conducted for 387 with outcome data. Multiple outcomes were defined as 3 or more of: depression, anxiety, suicide ideation, problematic alcohol use, or polysubstance use., RESULTS: Among bisexuals, 19.0 \% had multiple outcomes. We did not find variation in raw frequency of multiple outcomes across sociodemographic variables (e.g. gender, age). After adjustment, gender and sexual orientation identity were associated, with transgender women and those identifying as bisexual only more likely to have multiple outcomes. Social equity factors had a strong impact in both crude and adjusted analysis: controlling for other factors, high mental health/substance use burden was associated with greater discrimination (prevalence risk ratio (PRR) = 5.71; 95 \% CI: 2.08, 15.63) and lower education (PRR = 2.41; 95 \% CI: 1.06, 5.49), while higher income-to-needs ratio was protective (PRR = 0.44; 0.20, 1.00)., CONCLUSIONS: Mental health and substance use outcomes with high prevalence among bisexuals frequently co-occurred. We find some support for the theory that these multiple outcomes represent a syndemic, defined as co-occurring and mutually reinforcing adverse outcomes driven by social inequity.},

We investigated the structure of a network of CG and PTG elements to elucidate how grief and growth can co-occur within a potentially causal system in bereaved young adults. Challenges to control and identity disturbance ranked as the most highly central symptoms in the CG network; the discovery of a new life path and greater personal strength were similarly central elements of PTG. Finally, the degree of disruption and change in mourners' worldviews emerged as the element that most strongly bridged the two domains, suggesting a pivotal connection between grief and growth.},

A literature search uncovered 36 articles published between 2000 and 2016 that explicitly included bisexual women. The authors conducted a content analysis to assess study characteristics. Findings from the analysis indicated most research was conducted using quantitative methodology. Studies tended to use White, adult samples with little bisexual representation. Themes uncovered in the content analyses guided the literature review. Emergent reviewed themes included prevalence rates of IPV and tactics, risk factors for perpetration and victimization, and help seeking and leaving processes.

Current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for identifying PrEP candidates may not be specific enough to identify gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at the highest risk for HIV infection. We created an HIV risk score for HIV-negative MSM based on Syndemics Theory to develop a more targeted criterion for assessing PrEP candidacy., METHODS: Behavioral risk assessment and HIV testing data were analyzed for HIV-negative MSM attending the Los Angeles LGBT Center between January 2009 and June 2014 (n = 9481). Syndemics Theory informed the selection of variables for a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Estimated coefficients were summed to create an HIV risk score, and model fit was compared between our model and CDC guidelines using the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion., RESULTS: Approximately 51\% of MSM were above a cutpoint that we chose as an illustrative risk score to qualify for PrEP, identifying 75\% of all seroconverting MSM. Our model demonstrated a better overall fit when compared with the CDC guidelines (Akaike Information Criterion Difference = 68) in addition to identifying a greater proportion of HIV infections., CONCLUSIONS: Current CDC PrEP guidelines should be expanded to incorporate substance use, partner-level, and other Syndemic variables that have been shown to contribute to HIV acquisition. Deployment of such personalized algorithms may better hone PrEP criteria and allow providers and their patients to make a more informed decision prior to PrEP use.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States have a 50\% greater incidence of HIV when compared with White MSM. Previous studies have analyzed factors contributing to condomless anal intercourse among Latino MSM, but few studies have followed cohorts of HIV-negative Latino MSM to determine circumstances for HIV infection. Informed by Syndemics theory, we examine behavioral, biological, and contextual factors associated with HIV infection for Latino MSM., METHODS: Risk assessment and HIV testing data were analyzed for all initially HIV negative, Latino MSM (n = 3111) visiting a community-based clinic in Los Angeles, CA from January 2009 to June 2014. Survival analyses were used to determine characteristics of Latino MSM who became HIV positive during the study time frame., RESULTS: Similar to previous studies of MSM, self-reported history of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and/or syphilis (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.97; CI: 1.28 to 3.04), receptive condomless anal intercourse (aHR: 1.7; CI: 1.16 to 2.49), and methamphetamine use (aHR: 1.99; CI: 1.15 to 3.43) predicted HIV infection. In addition, originating from Central America (aHR: 2.31; CI: 1.41 to 3.79), Latino ethnicity of the last sex partner (aHR: 1.67; CI: 1.16 to 2.39) and experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) (aHR: 1.73; CI: 1.13 to 2.64) were also associated with HIV infection among Latino MSM., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show independent associations between IPV and HIV infection among Latino MSM. This study shows that psychosocial conditions such as IPV fuel HIV incidence among Latino MSM, and psychosocial interventions should be considered to reduce HIV disparities among Latino MSM.},

  abstract = {Latin America has some of the highest levels of antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage of any developing region in the world. Early initiation and optimal adherence to ART are necessary for improved health outcomes and reduction in onward transmission. Previous work has demonstrated the role of psychosocial problems as barriers to uptake and adherence to ART, and recently, a syndemic framework has been applied to the role of multiple psychosocial syndemic factors and adherence to ART, in the USA. However, to our knowledge, these associations have not been investigated outside of the USA, nor in a multi-country context. To address these gaps, we assessed the association between multiple co-occurring psychosocial factors and engagement in HIV-related medical care and adherence to ART among a large, multinational sample of sexually-active HIV-infected men who have sex with men in Latin America. Among the 2020 respondents, 80.7\% reported currently receiving HIV-related medical care, 72.3\% reported currently receiving ART; among those, 62.5\% reported 100\% adherence. Compared with experiencing no psychosocial health problems, experiencing five or more psychosocial health problems is associated with 42\% lower odds of currently receiving HIV-related medical care (adjusted odds ratio, aOR\,=\,0.58, 95\% CI 0.36, 0.95) and of currently receiving ART (aOR\,=\,0.58, 95\% CI 0.38, 0.91). The number of psychosocial health problems experienced was associated with self-reported ART adherence in a dose-response relationship; compared to those with none of the factors, individuals with one syndemic factor had 23\% lower odds (aOR\,=\,0.77, 95\% CI 0.60, 0.97) and individuals with five or more syndemic factors had 72\% lower odds (aOR = 0.28, 95\% CI 0.14, 0.55) of reporting being 100\% adherent to ART. Addressing co-occurring psychosocial problems as potential barriers to uptake and adherence of ART in Latin America may improve the effectiveness of secondary prevention interventions.},

We investigated mitochondrial toxic effects in children exposed to zidovudine in utero and after birth. Methods. We analysed observations of a trial of tolerance of combined zidovudine and lamivudine and preliminary results of a continuing retrospective analysis of clinical and biological symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction in children born to HIV-1-infected women in France. Mitochondrial dysfunction was studied by spectrophotometry and polarography of respiratory-chain complexes in various tissues. Findings. Eight children had mitochondrial dysfunction. Five, of whom two died, presented with delayed neurological symptoms and three were symptom-free but had severe biological or neurological abnormalities. Four of these children had been exposed to combined zidovudine and lamivudine, and four to zidovudine alone. No child was infected with HIV-1. All children had abnormally low absolute or relative activities of respiratory-chain complexes I, IV, or both months or years after the end of antiretroviral treatment. No mutation currently associated with constitutional disease was detected in any patient. Interpretation. Our findings support the hypothesis of a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the perinatal administration of prophylactic nucleoside analogues. Current recommendations for zidovudine monotherapy should however be maintained. Further assessment of the toxic effects of these drugs is required.},

  abstract = {Young Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) are a highly vulnerable population for HIV infection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a novel biomedical HIV prevention tool that may aid in reducing the disparity in HIV incidence among Latino MSM. However, PrEP use is disproportionally low among Latino MSM and, therefore, identifying barriers along the PrEP continuum of care (the "PrEP cascade") would provide insight into how to best deploy PrEP interventions. Syndemics theory is a prominent framework employed in HIV prevention; however, to date, no known studies have applied this theory to PrEP. Thus, the aim of the current study was to explore the association between syndemics and the PrEP cascade, including the degree to which psychosocial and structural syndemic constructs are related to the PrEP cascade. Participants were 151 young Latino MSM (M age\,=\,24~years; SD~=~3) residing in San Diego, California, who completed a battery of online self-report measures. Results indicated high levels of syndemic indicators and varying levels of engagement across the PrEP cascade. As syndemic indicators increased, the odds of engagement across the PrEP cascade were significantly lowered. Psychosocial and structural syndemic factors accounted for unique variance in the PrEP cascade. Results highlight the need for combination interventions that address both psychosocial and structural barriers to PrEP use and persistence among young Latino MSM.},

Data suggest that people in this group face a significant and poorly understood set of additional health risks and bear a higher burden of some diseases compared to the general population. A large amount of data is available on HIV/AIDS, but far less on other health problems. In this review we aimed to synthesize the knowledge on the burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, mental health conditions and violence experienced by SGM, based on available systematic reviews. We conducted a global review of systematic reviews, including searching the Cochrane and the Campbell Collaboration libraries, as well as PubMed, using a range of search terms describing the populations of interest, without time or language restrictions. Google Scholar was also scanned for unpublished literature, and references of all selected reviews were checked to identify further relevant articles. We found 30 systematic reviews, all originally written in English. Nine reviews provided data on HIV, 12 on other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), 4 on cancer, 4 on violence and 3 on mental health and substance use. A quantitative meta-analysis was not possible. The findings are presented in a narrative format. Our review primarily showed that there is a high burden of disease for certain subpopulations of SGM in HIV, STIs, STI-related cancers and mental health conditions, and that they also face high rates of violence. Secondly, our review revealed many knowledge gaps. Those gaps partly stem from a lack of original research, but there is an equally urgent need to conduct systematic and literature reviews to assess what we already know on the disease burden in SGM. Additional reviews are needed on the non-biological factors that could contribute to the higher disease burden. In addition, to provide universal access to health-care for all, more information is needed on the barriers that SGM face in accessing health services, including the attitudes of health-care providers. Understanding these barriers and the additional health risks they impose is crucial to improving the health status of SGM.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Portugal has the highest HIV incidence rate in Western Europe. The proportion assigned to sexual contact between men recently increased to more than 30\% of all HIV infections. Men who have sex with men (MSM) are vulnerable to the acquisition of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), increasing the per-contact risk of HIV infection. Building on syndemic theory, the aim of this analysis was to identify patterns of current sexual behaviour in MSM, and explore their relationship with self-reported current, past STI diagnoses and HIV positive serostatus., DESIGN: A cross-sectional behavioural survey was conducted in Portugal among MSM, using a community-based participatory research approach. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify patterns including behavioural and demographic factors., RESULTS: The analysis resulted in six clusters. Three clusters showed higher rates of current STI diagnosis (ranging from 11.7\% to 17.1\%), past STI diagnosis (ranging from 25.5\% to 41.5\%) and HIV positive serostatus (ranging from 13.0\% to 16.7\%). From the three clusters scoring lower on current and past STI and HIV diagnoses, one was characterised by a high number of sexual partners (62\% had more than 12 partners in the last year), a high proportion (94.6\%) of frequent visits to gay venues to meet sexual partners and high alcohol use (46.1\%). The other two clusters scored lower on high risk sexual behaviour., CONCLUSION: Factors other than sexual behaviour appear to reinforce the vulnerability to STIs and HIV of some MSM in this study, suggesting a syndemic of STIs, HIV and other adverse conditions. More research is needed to better understand the drivers of the STI/HIV epidemic in Portuguese MSM, using a concept that goes beyond risk behaviour, to develop effective combination prevention interventions.

The authors also show how network analysis techniques may be used to construct simulation models that mimic symptom dynamics. Network approaches naturally explain the limited success of traditional research strategies, which are typically based on the idea that symptoms are manifestations of some common underlying factor, while offering promising methodological alternatives. In addition, these techniques may offer possibilities to guide and evaluate therapeutic interventions.},

The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

  abstract = {Although current classification systems have greatly contributed to the reliability of psychiatric diagnoses, they ignore the unique role of individual symptoms and, consequently, potentially important information is lost. The network approach, in contrast, assumes that psychopathology results from the causal interplay between psychiatric symptoms and focuses specifically on these symptoms and their complex associations. By using a sophisticated network analysis technique, this study constructed an empirically based network structure of 120 psychiatric symptoms of twelve major DSM-IV diagnoses using cross-sectional data of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, second wave; N = 34,653). The resulting network demonstrated that symptoms within the same diagnosis showed differential associations and indicated that the strategy of summing symptoms, as in current classification systems, leads to loss of information. In addition, some symptoms showed strong connections with symptoms of other diagnoses, and these specific symptom pairs, which both concerned overlapping and non-overlapping symptoms, may help to explain the comorbidity across diagnoses. Taken together, our findings indicated that psychopathology is very complex and can be more adequately captured by sophisticated network models than current classification systems. The network approach is, therefore, promising in improving our understanding of psychopathology and moving our field forward.},

  abstract = {Objectives In this narrative review we illustrate the patterns of substance use among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM), including comparisons with heterosexual populations, subgroup analyses and settings of substance use. We also consider explanations and motivations for substance use and the impact of use on sexual health as well as wider health and well-being. Finally, we consider the implications for the provision of MSM-tailored substance use and harm reduction services. Methods We undertook a narrative review of diverse literature across the fields of public health, psychology and sociology to synthesise complex findings relating to the use and impacts of illicit drugs and alcohol among MSM. Attempts were made to draw on literature from across the globe, including all income settings. Results Global evidence relating to the use of substances among MSM is limited due to the lack of disaggregation of data by sexual orientation. While complicated by methodological diversity, most research indicates a higher prevalence of illicit drug use among MSM compared with their heterosexual counterparts, although the same is not necessarily true of alcohol. A sense of belonging, coping with everyday problems and the enhancement of pleasure, all feature in motivations for alcohol and drug use. Global association studies document a link between substance use and sexual risk behaviours, and event-level analyses suggest an especially strong association with respect to alcohol. While there is some evidence that generic harm reduction interventions can be effective among sexual minorities, these need to be tailored to the social and cultural circumstances of MSM. Conclusions Associations between substance use and sexual risk behaviour among MSM have been well documented, but the nature and pathway of these are poorly understood. A focus largely on substance use and sexual risk may have served to mask the impact of alcohol and drug use on the broader health and well-being of MSM.},

The objective of this study was to examine current use of PrEP, likelihood of future use and indicators of potential PrEP candidacy among an opportunistic sample of men who have sex with men in Europe and Central Asia. METHODS A survey was sent out in eight languages to users of the Hornet gay networking application in July and August 2017. Descriptive statistics present proportions of PrEP use, while factors associated with PrEP use are examined using logistic and linear regressions. RESULTS Of 12 053 participants whose responses came from 55 European and Central Asian countries, 10 764 (89\%) were not living with diagnosed HIV. Among these HIV-negative/untested men, 10.1\% (n=1071) were currently taking PrEP or had done so within the previous 3 months. Current or recent PrEP users were significantly more likely to have taken postexposure prophylaxis (adjusted OR (AOR)=16.22 (95\% CI 13.53 to 19.45)) or received an STI diagnosis (AOR=4.53 (95\% CI 3.77 to 5.44)) in the previous 12 months than those who had not. Most commonly, these men obtained PrEP from a physician (28.1\%) or the internet (24.8\%), while 33.6\% had not disclosed PrEP use to their doctor. Men reporting happiness with their sex life were more likely to have taken PrEP (AOR=1.73 (95\% CI 1.59 to 1.89)). Nearly a quarter (21.5\%) of those not on PrEP said they were likely to use it in the next 6 months. CONCLUSIONS The majority of men using, or intending to use, PrEP appear to have a risk profile consistent with emerging guidance. A large proportion of these men are accessing PrEP outside of traditional healthcare settings, posing a challenge for routine monitoring.},

  abstract = {An important element in the development of voluntary blood donation schemes throughout the world has been the attention given to minimising the risk to recipients of donated blood, primarily the risk of transfusion transmitted infections. In response to the appearance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the 1980s a range of national policies emerged that excluded populations at high risk of contracting HIV from donating blood, with a particular focus on men who have sex with men (MSM), the primary reason being the protection of recipients of donated blood. Recently some countries, including the UK, have revised their policies, informed by advances in screening tests, epidemiological evidence of transmission rates and an increasing concern about unfair discrimination of specific groups in society. Policy makers face a difficult task of balancing safety of recipients; an adequate blood supply for those who require transfusion; and societal/legal obligations to treat everyone fairly. Given that no transfusion is risk free, the question is what degree of risk is acceptable in order to meet the needs of recipients and society. Decisions about acceptance of risk are complex and policy makers who set acceptable risk levels must provide ethically justifiable reasons for their decisions. We suggest it is possible to provide a set of reasons that stakeholders could agree are relevant based on careful evaluation of the evidence of all relevant risks and explicit acknowledgement of other morally relevant values. We describe using such a process in the Safety of Blood Tissue and Organs (SaBTO) review of donor deferral criteria related to sexual behaviour.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from a national sample of sexual minority women (i.e., women who either reported a history of female sexual partners or identified as nonheterosexual) aged 20-59 from the 2003 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 830). Weighted logistic regression identified correlates of infection with any HPV type and infection with a high-risk HPV type. RESULTS: About 53\% of women were infected with any HPV type, and about 37\% were infected with a high-risk HPV type. Women who reported five or more sexual partners during their lifetime (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.07, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.26-11.42) were more likely to be infected with a high-risk HPV type. Compared to women aged 20-29, women aged 40-49 (aOR = 0.51, 95\% CI: 0.32-0.81) or 50-59 (aOR = 0.27, 95\% CI: 0.14-0.53) were less likely to be infected with a high-risk HPV type, as were women who were married or living with a partner (aOR = 0.62, 95\% CI: 0.44-0.89). Mostly similar correlates were identified for infection with any HPV type, although infection with any HPV type was also less common among women who identified as lesbian compared to those who identified as heterosexual (aOR = 0.38, 95\% CI: 0.21-0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Demographic and health-related characteristics were associated with HPV infection outcomes. Findings can inform HPV prevention efforts for sexual minority women by providing information about risk factors and subgroups at particular risk for infection.},

The object of this study was to (1) explore sexual orientation-based differences in substance use, psychological distress, and their co-occurrence in a representative sample in Sweden, and (2) examine if greater exposure to stressors, such as discrimination, victimization/threats, and social isolation, could explain these potential disparities and their co-occurrence., METHODS: Data come from the cross-sectional Swedish National Public Health Survey, which collected random samples of individuals (16-84 years of age) annually from 2008 to 2015, with an overall response rate of 49.7\% (n = 79,568 individuals; 1673 self-identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual). Population-level sexual orientation differences in substance use (i.e., alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis) and psychological distress were examined., RESULTS: Our findings showed significantly elevated prevalence of high-risk alcohol use, cannabis use, and daily tobacco smoking, among sexual minorities compared to heterosexuals. These substantial disparities in substance use more often co-occurred with psychological distress among sexual minorities than among heterosexuals. The elevated risk of co-occurring psychological distress and substance use was most notable among gay men relative to heterosexual men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.65, CI 1.98, 3.55), and bisexual women relative to heterosexual women (AOR = 3.01, CI 2.43, 3.72). Multiple mediation analyses showed that experiences of discrimination, victimization, and social isolation partially explained the sexual orientation disparity in these co-occurring problems., CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to a growing body of research showing that sexual minorities experience multiple threats to optimal health and points toward future interventions that address the shared sources of these overlapping health threats in stigma-related stress.},

This study aimed to conduct a population-based examination of clinically assessed syndemic predictors of HIV infection among gay and bisexual, compared with heterosexual, men. SETTING AND METHODS: The sample comprised adult men in the Stockholm Public Health Cohort. A total of 29,328 (91.9\%) self-identified as heterosexual, 535 (1.7\%) as gay, and 396 (1.2\%) as bisexual. We linked survey responses to national health registry data. RESULTS: Gay men had vastly elevated risk of HIV infection ({$>$}150 times) compared with heterosexuals. Gay men also had an elevated risk of depression, suicidality, and violent assaults compared with heterosexuals. Bisexual men had 16 times higher risk of being HIV-positive than heterosexual men. The number of psychosocial syndemic conditions was significantly associated with HIV infection among gay men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.67; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: 1.18 to 2.36), but not among bisexual and heterosexual men (AOR = 0.51; 95\% CI: 0.07 to 3.59; AOR = 1.92; 95\% CI: 0.96 to 3.84). Among gay men, the association between co-occurring syndemic conditions and odds of HIV infection was synergistic (ie, more than additive). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms emerging evidence of the syndemic health threats affecting sexual minority men, finds stronger evidence for syndemics among gay compared with bisexual men, and suggests the need for HIV-prevention interventions that comprehensively address the co-occurring, and synergistically perpetuating, disparities affecting this population.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To close gaps in transgender health research, we mapped trends in gender affirmation processes (i.e., social, legal, and psychological transitions) that are unique among nonbinary (NB) transgender adults when compared with transgender women (TW) and transgender men (TM). Methods: Data were drawn from the Columbia Trans Empowerment Survey (N = 707), an online national study conducted between 2014 and 2015 in the United States. We used one-way analysis of variance tests, chi-square tests, Kruskal\textendash Wallis tests, and post hoc analyses to estimate differences in gender affirmation processes and transgender congruence between: (1) NB adults, n = 271, 38\%; (2) TW, n = 291, 41\%; and (3) TM, n = 145, 21\%. We then identified bivariate correlations between variables of interest. Results: In the full sample (n = 707), we found significant positive bivariate correlations between pursuing gender affirmation and transgender congruence. In terms of demographics, NB participants were significantly more likely to be queer (42.1\%), polyamorous (25.5\%), unemployed (44.8\%), and younger (median = 22) than TW and TM. They also reported taking significantly fewer gender affirmation processes, with significant differences between the three groups in terms of particular experiences. The NB participants also reported significantly lower rates of transgender congruence, specifically lower appearance congruence though similar gender identity acceptance. Conclusion: The NB transgender adults in this sample report unique identity-related characteristics, including significantly lower rates of medical/social transition as well as decreased transgender congruence. These data are among the first to describe unique pathways by which NB adults, TW, and TM may pursue gender affirmation and interact with providers as they navigate congruence, transition, and well-being.},

Although the syndemic theory proposes a developmental trajectory, it has been largely based on epidemiological studies of adult gay men and has not been examined using qualitative data from gay male adolescents and emerging adults describing their developmental experience. We conducted interviews with 54 HIV-positive gay and bisexual male adolescents and emerging adults at four sites in the United States. This study provides examples of developmental trajectories that help explain the early onset of socially produced health disparities among some gay male adolescents and emerging adults, but also the development of risk factors that may follow some gay men into adulthood.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To use a network analysis approach to identify the nature of the association between PTSD symptoms in the acute phase after trauma and the chronic phase. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective cohort study enrolled 1138 patients recently admitted with traumatic injury to 1 of 4 major trauma hospitals across Australia from March 13, 2004, to February 26, 2006. Participants underwent assessment during hospital admission (n = 1388) and at 12 months after injury (n = 852). Networks of symptom associations were analyzed in the acute and chronic phases using partial correlations, relative importance estimates, and centrality measures of each symptom in terms of its association strengths, closeness to other symptoms, and importance in connecting other symptoms to each other. Data were analyzed from March 3 to September 5, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Severity of PTSD was assessed at each assessment with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. RESULTS Of the 1138 patients undergoing assessment at admission (837 men [73.6\%] and 301 women [26.4\%]; mean [SD] age, 37.90 [13.62] years), strong connections were found in the acute phase. Reexperiencing symptoms were central to other symptoms in the acute phase, with intrusions and physiological reactivity among the most central symptoms in the networks in terms of the extent to which they occur between other symptoms (mean [SD], 1.2 [0.7] and 1.0 [0.9], respectively), closeness to other symptoms (mean [SD], 0.9 [0.3] and 1.1 [0.9], respectively), and strength of the associations (mean [SD], 1.6 [0.3] and 1.5 [0.3] respectively) among flashbacks, intrusions, and avoidance of thoughts, with moderately strong connections between intrusions and nightmares, being upset by reminders, and physiological reactivity. Intrusions and physiological reactivity were central in the acute phase. Among the 852 patients (73.6\%) who completed the 12-month assessment, overall network connectivity was significantly stronger at 12 months than in the acute phase (global strength values, 6.57 vs 7.60; paired difference, 1.03; P {$<$} .001). The network associations among the reexperiencing symptoms were strengthened at 12 months, and physiological reactivity was strongly associated with the startle response, which was also associated with hypervigilance. Strong connectivity among emotional numbing, detachment from others, and disinterest in activities as well as moderately strong links among irritability (anger), concentration deficits, and sleep disturbance were found. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE As time elapses after trauma, fear circuitry and dysphoric PTSD symptoms appear to emerge as connected networks. Intrusive memories and reactivity are centrally associated with other symptoms in the acute phase, potentially pointing to the utility of addressing these symptoms in early intervention strategies.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, the incidence of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has shown a significant increase in recent years. In Germany, this circumstance is reflected by a rise in the number of reported syphilis cases. There has also been an uptick in the incidence of non-notifiable STIs such as gonorrhea and infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium. A key factor in the spread of these infections is their varied clinical presentation, which includes urogenital, pharyngeal and rectal involvement as well as a large number of asymptomatic cases. New real-time multiplex PCR methods allow for rapid and targeted detection of STI pathogens. The most common bacterial STI is urogenital chlamydial infection caused by serovars D-K, which affects young adults in particular. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) caused by L serovars often presents as chlamydial proctitis. In recent years, Neisseria (N.) gonorrhoeae has shown a significant development of resistance, with high-level monoresistance and multiresistance to antibiotics commonly used for treatment. It is therefore imperative that sensitivity testing of N. gonorrhoeae be performed in addition to nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Increased drug resistance has also been observed for Mycoplasma genitalium, a fact that complicates treatment.},

  abstract = {Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) among men who have sex with men (MSM) is a significant problem. Little is known about the association between IPV and health for MSM. We aimed to estimate the association between experience and perpetration of IPV, and various health conditions and sexual risk behaviours among MSM. Methods and Findings: We searched 13 electronic databases up to 23 October 2013 to identify research studies reporting the odds of health conditions or sexual risk behaviours for MSM experiencing or perpetrating IPV. Nineteen studies with 13,797 participants were included in the review. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs). Exposure to IPV as a victim was associated with increased odds of substance use (OR = 1.88, 95\% CIOR 1.59\textendash 2.22, I2 = 46.9\%, 95\% CII2 0\%\textendash 78\%), being HIV positive (OR = 1.46, 95\% CIOR 1.26\textendash 1.69, I2 = 0.0\%, 95\% CII2 0\%\textendash 62\%), reporting depressive symptoms (OR = 1.52, 95\% CIOR 1.24\textendash 1.86, I2 = 9.9\%, 95\% CII2 0\%\textendash 91\%), and engagement in unprotected anal sex (OR = 1.72, 95\% CIOR 1.44\textendash 2.05, I2 = 0.0\%, 95\% CII2 0\%\textendash 68\%). Perpetration of IPV was associated with increased odds of substance use (OR = 1.99, 95\% CIOR 1.33\textendash 2.99, I2 = 73.1\%). These results should be interpreted with caution because of methodological weaknesses such as the lack of validated tools to measure IPV in this population and the diversity of recall periods and key outcomes in the identified studies. Conclusions: MSM who are victims of IPV are more likely to engage in substance use, suffer from depressive symptoms, be HIV positive, and engage in unprotected anal sex. MSM who perpetrate IPV are more likely to engage in substance use. Our results highlight the need for research into effective interventions to prevent IPV in MSM, as well as the importance of providing health care professionals with training in how to address issues of IPV among MSM and the need to raise awareness of local and national support services.},

The minority stress hypothesis contends that the stigma and discrimination experienced by sexual minority youth create a hostile social environment that can lead to chronic stress and mental health problems. The present study used longitudinal mediation models to directly test sexual minority-specific victimization as a potential explanatory mechanism of the mental health disparities of sexual minority youth. One hundred ninety-seven adolescents (14-19 years old; 70 \% female; 29 \% sexual minority) completed measures of sexual minority-specific victimization, depressive symptoms, and suicidality at two time points 6 months apart. Compared to heterosexual youth, sexual minority youth reported higher levels of sexual minority-specific victimization, depressive symptoms, and suicidality. Sexual minority-specific victimization significantly mediated the effect of sexual minority status on depressive symptoms and suicidality. The results support the minority stress hypothesis that targeted harassment and victimization are partly responsible for the higher levels of depressive symptoms and suicidality found in sexual minority youth. This research lends support to public policy initiatives that reduce bullying and hate crimes because reducing victimization can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of sexual minority youth.},

In total, this search yielded 31 reports that included sleep data collected from sexual and gender minority participants. Overall, research findings are mixed and include several publications of studies conducted in the same sample. Our review suggests that sleep health among LGBT individuals may be an unmet health need. Critically, sleep disturbances affected LGBT subgroups differently based on sex/gender and diverse sexual orientations (e.g., bisexual women). Although not directly tested, evidence from parallel LGBT health research suggests that minority stress may contribute to these observed sleep disparities and will need to be directly assessed in future studies. In sum, continued investigation of sleep disparities among sexual and gender minority communities is needed, as is the inclusion of sleep health in theoretical models of LGBT health disparities. Given the importance of sleep in overall mental and physical health, addressing sleep health may serve to promote and protect healthy functioning among LGBT individuals.},

  abstract = {Rates of HIV infection continue to climb among minority populations and men who have sex with men (MSM), with African American/Black MSM being especially impacted. Numerous studies have found HIV transmission risk to be associated with many health and social disparities resulting from larger environmental and structural forces. Using anthropological and social environment-based theories of resilience that focus on individual agency and larger social and environmental structures, this dissertation employed a mixed methods design to investigate resilience processes among African American/Black MSM. Quantitative analyses compared African American/Black (N=108) and Caucasian/White (N=250) MSM who participated in a previously conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT) of sexual and substance use risk reduction interventions. At RCT study entry, using past 90 day recall periods, there were no differences in unprotected sex frequency, however African American/Black MSM reported higher frequencies of days high (P{$<$}0.000), and drugs and sex used in combination (P{$<$}0.000), and substance dependence (P{$<$}0.000) and lower levels of social support (P{$<$}0.024) compared to Caucasian/White MSM. At 12- month follow-up, multi-level statistical models found that African American/Black MSM reduced their frequencies of days high and unprotected sex at greater rates than Caucasian/White MSM (P{$<$}0.001). Qualitative data collected among a sub-sample of African American/Black MSM from the RCT (N=21) described the men's experiences of living with multiple health and social disparities and the importance of RCT study assessments in facilitating reductions in risk behaviors. A cross-case analysis showed different resilience processes undertaken by men who experienced low socioeconomic status, little family support, and homophobia (N=16) compared to those who did not (N=5). The dissertation concludes that resilience processes to HIV transmission risk and related health and social disparities among African American/Black MSM varies and are dependent on specific social environmental factors, including social relationships, structural homophobia, and access to social, economic, and cultural capital. Men define for themselves what it means to be resilient within their social environment. These conclusions suggest that both individual and structural-level resilience-based HIV prevention interventions are needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

It is important to ensure that screening has benefits that outweigh the risks of increased antibiotics resistance. We develop a mathematical model to estimate the effectiveness of screening on prevalence. Separable Temporal Exponential family Random Graph Models are used to model the sexual relationships network, both with main and casual partners. Next, the transmission of Gonorrhoea is simulated on this network. The models are implemented using the R package `statnet', which we adapted among other things to incorporate infection status at the pharynx, urethra and rectum separately and to distinguish between anal sex, oral sex and rimming. The different screening programmes compared are no screening, 3.5\% of the population screened, 32\% screened and 50\% screened. The model simulates day-by-day evolution for 10 years of a population of 10 000. If half of the population would be screened, the prevalence in the pharynx decreases from 11.9\% to 10.2\%. We conclude that the limited impact of screening on NG prevalence may not outweigh the increased risk of antibiotic resistance.},

  abstract = {Syndemic theory posits that epidemics of multiple physical and psychosocial problems co-occur among disadvantaged groups due to adverse social conditions. Although sexual minority populations are often stigmatized and vulnerable to multiple health problems, the syndemic perspective has been underutilized in understanding chronic disease. To assess the potential utility of this perspective in understanding the management of co-occurring HIV and Type 2 diabetes, we used linear regression to examine glycemic control (A1c) among men who have sex with men (MSM) with both HIV and Type 2 diabetes (n~=~88). Bivariable linear regression explored potential syndemic correlates of inadequate glycemic control. Compared to those with adequate glycemic control (A1c~{$\leq~$}7.5~\%), more men with inadequate glycemic control (A1c~{$>~$}7.5~\%) had hypertension (70 vs. 46~\%, p~=~0.034), high triglycerides (93 vs. 61~\%, p~=~0.002), depression (67 vs. 39~\%, p~=~0.018), current substance abuse (15 vs. 2~\%, p~=~0.014), and detectable levels of HIV (i.e., viral load {$\geq$}75 copies per ml blood; 30 vs. 10~\%, p~=~0.019). In multivariable regression controlling for age, the factors that were independently associated with higher A1c were high triglycerides, substance use, and detectable HIV viral load, suggesting that chronic disease management among MSM is complex and challenging for patients and providers. Findings also suggest that syndemic theory can be a clarifying lens for understanding chronic disease management among sexual minority stigmatized populations. Interventions targeting single conditions may be inadequate when multiple conditions co-occur; thus, research using a syndemic framework may be helpful in identifying intervention strategies that target multiple co-occurring conditions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Institute of Medicine and The Joint Commission have recommended asking sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) questions in clinical settings and including such data in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This is increasingly viewed as a critical step toward systematically documenting and addressing health disparities affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. The U.S. government is currently considering whether to include SOGI data collection in the Stage 3 guidelines for the incentive program promoting meaningful use of EHR. However, some have questioned whether acceptable standard measures to collect SOGI data in clinical settings exist. METHODS: In order to better understand how a diverse group of patients would respond if SOGI questions were asked in primary care settings, 301 randomly selected patients receiving primary care at four health centers across the U.S. were asked SOGI questions and then asked follow-up questions. This sample was mainly heterosexual, racially diverse, and geographically and regionally broad. RESULTS: There was a strong consensus among patients surveyed about the importance of asking SOGI questions. Most of the LGBT respondents thought that the questions presented on the survey allowed them to accurately document their SOGI. Most respondents--heterosexual and LGBT--answered the questions, and said that they would answer such questions in the future. While there were some age-related differences, respondents of all ages overwhelmingly expressed support for asking SOGI questions and understood the importance of providers' knowing their patients' SOGI. CONCLUSIONS: Given current deliberations within national health care regulatory bodies and the government's increased attention to LGBT health disparities, the finding that patients can and will answer SOGI questions has important implications for public policy. This study provides evidence that integrating SOGI data collection into the meaningful use requirements is both acceptable to diverse samples of patients, including heterosexuals, and feasible.},

Yet our review of recently published empirical articles reveals that demographic gender measurement in psychology still assumes that gender comprises just two categories: women and men. This common practice is problematic. It fails to represent psychologists' current understanding of gender, violates our ethical principles as scientists, and can result in gender misclassification. Psychologists' reliance on binary measures also conveys an exclusionary attitude that is contrary to recent ethical recommendations and contrary to the growing public concern about transgender rights. We extend five simple, no-cost recommendations that begin to resolve these ethical and methodological problems: use and report, nonbinary gender measures; report the prevalence of nonbinary participants; clarify their inclusion and treatment in analysis; and use gender inclusive language. We also address common concerns expressed by researchers, including whether measuring "sex" resolves the issue and whether gender-inclusive measures confuse or offend participants.},

  abstract = {Many individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and with other non-heterosexual orientations (LGBQ+) experience stigma, prejudice, and/or discrimination because of their sexuality. According to minority stress and identity development theories, these experiences can contribute to difficulties with self-acceptance of sexuality. Lower self-acceptance is considered a risk factor for adverse mental health outcomes. The current review aims to investigate whether self-acceptance of sexuality is associated with minority stressors or difficulties with mental health in LGBQ+ individuals, as well as whether there are differences in self-acceptance between different sexual orientations. Five bibliographic databases were searched. Thirteen studies were identified which used quantitative methodology to investigate associations between self-acceptance, minority stressors, and/or mental health within LGBQ+ samples, or differences in self-acceptance between different sexual orientations. The results from these cross-sectional studies suggested that lower self-acceptance of sexuality was associated with higher levels of self-reported minority stressors, including a lack of acceptance from friends and family, a lack of disclosure to others, and internalized heterosexism. Lower self-acceptance of sexuality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes, including greater global distress, depression symptoms, and lower psychological well-being. There was no significant relationship with suicidality. Studies also found that LGBQ+ individuals had lower general self-acceptance compared to heterosexual participants, bisexual individuals had lower sexuality self-acceptance compared to lesbian/gay individuals, and lesbian women had lower sexuality self-acceptance compared to gay men. Given the potential importance of self-acceptance for LGBQ+ populations, further research is required with more robust methodology. Self-acceptance could be a potential target in clinical interventions for LGBQ+ individuals.},

  abstract = {Lesbian and bisexual women experience significantly higher rates of sexual assault and rape compared with heterosexual women. Despite this, researchers have yet to distinguish whether sexual orientation itself or some other related social characteristics explain these higher rates. The objective of this study was to analyze women's rates of sexual assault and rape across sexual orientation status while accounting for other social characteristics (e.g., race, education, income, outness). Women ( N = 1,366), who identified as lesbian (31\%), bisexual (32\%), and heterosexual (31\%), completed a nationally distributed, cross-sectional online survey in 2016. Victimization and repeat victimization were assessed using a modified version of Sexual Experience Survey\textendash Short Form Victimization. Overall, 63\% of bisexual, 49\% of lesbian, and 35\% of heterosexual women reported experiencing rape in their lifetime. When holding all other social characteristics constant, sexual orientation remained a significant predictor in the model. Compared with the odds of heterosexual women experiencing sexual assault or rape, bisexual women (3.7 odds of victimization; 7.3 odds of repeat victimization) and lesbian women (3.2 odds of repeat victimization) were disproportionately victimized. Sexual orientation clearly plays a role in sexual victimization risk, independent of other measured sociodemographic indicators. Continued research is needed to explore possible mechanisms behind sexual assault and rape prevalence, as well as the influence of contextual factors of victimization risk among sexual minority men.},

It is now recognized that TGNC people experience disproportionate rates of negative mental health outcomes relative to both their gender-normative, hetero-sexual peers, as well as their gender-normative lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) peers. The theoretical basis of current transgender mental health research is rooted in the Minority Stress Model, which postulates that we live in a hetero-cen-tric, gender-normative society that stigmatizes and discrimi-nates against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, subjecting them to chronic stress (Hendricks \& Testa, 2012; Meyer, 1995). This chronic, potentially compounding stress, is responsible for the increased risk of negative mental health outcomes in LGBT populations. TGNC people, in par-ticular, may experience more adverse outcomes than their LGB peers due to rejection and discrimination within society at large as well as within the LGB community.},

Compared to METH-HIV- men, METH + HIV+ MSM displayed 10\% higher log10 cortisol levels per standard deviation lower ACTH. Both groups of methamphetamine-using MSM had lower insulin resistance and greater syndemic burden (i.e., sleep disturbance, severe depression, childhood trauma, and polysubstance use disorder) compared to METH-HIV- men. However, the disaggregated functional relationship between ACTH and cortisol in METH + HIV+ MSM was independent of these factors., CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to characterize the bio-behavioral pathways that explain dysregulated HPA axis functioning in HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM.

Although behavioral interventions for SUMSM are one potentially important component of biobehavioral HIV/AIDS prevention, further research is needed to examine whether integrative approaches that cultivate resilience and target co-occurring syndemic conditions demonstrate greater efficacy.

We describe the places in which African American and Latinx MSM interviewees live and socialize, and how these places influence sexual behavior, drug use, and access to health care. We find common spatial patterns in mobility, incongruence in residential and sexual places, and differing geographic patterns of sex by men who use geo-social hook-up apps. Significant instability in home life and varying forms of mobility and risk-taking were a response to cumulative disadvantage and intersecting structural forces including poverty, racism, and homophobia. Our results strongly suggest that geographic mobility is a syndemic factor for HIV risk among MSM in Los Angeles, as mobility amplified negative impacts of other syndemic factors. Innovative place-interventions to reduce HIV incidence and disparities in HIV need to acknowledge the synergistic factors that drive higher HIV incidence among AA and Latinx MSM.},

  abstract = {We examined the presence and co-occurrence of psychosocial health conditions (depression, frequent alcohol use, and victimisation) among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender (TG) women in India, and their cumulative association with sexual risk. A survey questionnaire was administered among a convenience sample of 600 participants (MSM\,=\,300; TG women\,=\,300) recruited through six non-governmental organisations in four states. Prevalences of the number of psychosocial health conditions among MSM were: none\,=\,31.3\%, one\,=\,43\%, two\,=\,20\%, and three\,=\,5.7\%; and among TG women: none\,=\,9\%; one\,=\,35.33\%, two\,=\,38.33\%, and three\,=\,17.33\%. In bivariate and multivariate models, these conditions were positively and additively related to sexual risk, providing evidence for a syndemic of psychosocial health conditions among MSM and TG women and their synergistic effect on sexual risk. In addition to the number of syndemic conditions, resilient coping and social support were significant predictors of sexual risk among MSM and TG women, respectively. HIV preventive interventions in India should screen for and address co-occurring psychosocial health conditions - experiences of violence, mental health issues, and alcohol use - among MSM and TG women.},

  abstract = {Syndemic theory could explain the elevated HIV risk among transgender women (TGW) in India. Using cross-sectional data of 300 TGW in India, we aimed to: identify latent classes of four syndemic conditions (Depression-D, Alcohol use-A, Violence victimization-V, HIV-positive status), test whether syndemic classes mediate the association between stigma and sexual risk, and test whether social support and resilient coping moderate the association between syndemic classes and sexual risk. Four distinct classes emerged: (1) DAV Syndemic, (2) AV Syndemic, (3) DV Syndemic, and (4) No Syndemic. TGW in the DAV Syndemic (OR 9.80, 95\% CI 3.45, 27.85, p {$<$} 0.001) and AV Syndemic classes (OR 2.74, 95\% CI 1.19, 6.32, p {$<$} 0.01) had higher odds of inconsistent condom use in the past month than the No Syndemic class. Social support significantly moderated the effect of DAV Syndemic class on inconsistent condom use. DAV Syndemic was found to be a significant mediator of the effect of transgender identity stigma on sexual risk. HIV prevention programs among TGW need to: (a) incorporate multi-level multi-component interventions to address syndemic conditions, tailored to the nature of syndemic classes; (b) reduce societal stigma against TGW; and (c) improve social support to buffer the impact of syndemics on sexual risk.},

  abstract = {The theory of syndemics has been used to explain elevated HIV risk facing men who have sex with men (MSM). However, few studies have employed suitable analytical methods to test this theory. Using data from a probability-based sample of MSM in India, we tested three proposed models linking the co-occurring epidemics of violence victimisation, drug use, and frequent alcohol use to HIV risk: 1) the syndemic model of synergistically interacting epidemics; 2) the "chains of risk" model; and 3) the model of mutually causal epidemics. The primary outcome was inconsistent condom use with male or hijra (transgender women) partners in the past month. For the syndemic model, we included product terms between the exposures and assessed for interaction on the additive (linear probability regression) and multiplicative (logistic regression) scales. Path analysis was used to test the models of serially causal epidemics and mutually causal epidemics. Among 22,297 HIV-negative MSM, violence victimisation (24.7\%), frequent alcohol use (27.5\%), and drug use (10.9\%) frequently co-occurred. We found evidence for a three-way interaction between violence victimisation, drug use and frequent alcohol use on both the multiplicative (semi-elasticity = 0.28; 95\% CI 0.10, 0.47) and additive (b = 0.14; 95\% CI 0.01, .27) scales. We also estimated statistically significant two-way interactions between violence victimisation and frequent alcohol use on the multiplicative (semi-elasticity = .10; 95\% CI 0.008, 0.20) and additive (b = 0.05, 95\% CI 0.002, 0.107) scales, and between drug use and frequent alcohol use on the multiplicative (semi-elasticity = 0.13, 95\% CI 0.02, 0.24) and additive (b = 0.06, 95\% CI 0.007, 0.129) scales. Thus, we found strong evidence for the syndemic model. The models of serially causal and mutually causal epidemics were partially supported. These findings highlight the need to sharpen how syndemic models are specified so that their empirical predictions can be adequately tested and distinguished from other theories of disease distribution.},

Five focus groups were conducted among a purposive sample of diverse men along with seven key informant interviews with HIV service providers. Participants' narratives suggested various pathways by which syndemic conditions interact with one another to sequentially or concurrently increase HIV risk. Experiences of discrimination and violence from a range of perpetrators (family, ruffians and police) contributed to internalised homonegativity and/or depression, which in turn led some men to use alcohol as a coping strategy. Stigma related to same-sex sexuality, gender non-conformity and sex work contributed to the production of one or more syndemic conditions. While rejection by family and male regular partners contributed to depression/alcohol use, support from family, regular partners and peers served as resources of resilience. In India, HIV prevention and health promotion efforts among men who have sex with men could be strengthened by multi-level multi-component interventions to reduce intersectional/intersecting stigma, address syndemic conditions and foster resilience - especially by promoting family acceptance and peer support.},

The present study examined how HIV-related discrimination contributes to co-occurring psychosocial syndemic problems and results in inconsistent condom use among PLHIV in Hong Kong. Two-hundred and ninety-one PLHIV were recruited to complete a self-report questionnaire. More than one-quarter of the sample experienced two or more psychosocial syndemic problems, and 74.1\% of the participants who had sex with steady partners reported inconsistent condom use over the past three months. The results indicated that HIV-related discrimination was positively predictive of the number of psychosocial syndemic problems. HIV-related discrimination and psychosocial syndemics were associated with increased odds of inconsistent condom use with steady partners (AOR = 5.40 and AOR = 3.09 respectively). Findings from structural equation modeling showed that psychosocial syndemics mediated the effect of HIV-related discrimination on condom use consistency with steady partners. PLHIV in Hong Kong suffered from the syndemic effects of stigma, social isolation, and poor mental health, which rendered them vulnerable to condomless sex. In order to curb the rapidly increasing incidence of HIV, multi-level strategies should be adopted to concurrently address the structural inequities and psychosocial syndemics faced by PLHIV.},

Further, BMSM-SW have been shown to have higher rates of syndemic psychosocial health conditions which contribute to HIV risk behavior and incidence, and poorer care outcomes than other groups of men who have sex with men. However, syndemic perspectives have not been applied to understanding past-year STI burden among BMSM-SW in the U.S. Sexually active Black MSM {$>$}= 18 years old were recruited from Black Pride events in six U.S. cities (n = 4421) between 2014 and 2017. Multivariable logistic regressions assessed correlates of past-year sex work engagement; whether BMSM-SW had higher odds of syndemic conditions; and whether BMSM-SW had higher odds of self-reported, past-year STI diagnoses. Structural equation models assessed relationships between sex work engagement, syndemic conditions, and STI controlled for sociodemographics and number of sexual partners. A total of 254 (5.7\%) Black MSM reported past-year sex work, of whom 45.3\% were HIV positive. BMSM-SW were significantly more likely to be Hispanic, to report past-year bisexual behavior, and to report annual income {$<$} \$10,000. In multivariable models, BMSM-SW were significantly more likely to report intimate partner violence, assault victimization, polydrug use, and depression symptoms; they were also more likely to report past-year gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. Syndemic conditions mediated the relationship between past-year sex work and past-year STI burden, constituting a significant indirect effect. BMSM-SW in the U.S. face severe biopsychosocial health disparities. Interventions developed for BMSM engaged in sex work are lacking. Our results suggest that interventions containing safer sex work education and sex-positive biobehavioral HIV/STI prevention alongside substance use, mental health, employment, and education components will be most effective.

Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death. Observations: Defined as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] {$<$}60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria {$\geq$}30 mg per 24 hours) for more than 3 months, CKD affects 8\% to 16\% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, CKD is most commonly attributed to diabetes and hypertension. However, less than 5\% of patients with early CKD report awareness of their disease. Among individuals diagnosed as having CKD, staging and new risk assessment tools that incorporate GFR and albuminuria can help guide treatment, monitoring, and referral strategies. Optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction (eg, statins and blood pressure management), treatment of albuminuria (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers), avoidance of potential nephrotoxins (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjustments to drug dosing (eg, many antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic agents). Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia. Those at high risk of CKD progression (eg, estimated GFR {$<$}30 mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria {$\geq$}300 mg per 24 hours, or rapid decline in estimated GFR) should be promptly referred to a nephrologist. Conclusions and Relevance: Diagnosis, staging, and appropriate referral of CKD by primary care clinicians are important in reducing the burden of CKD worldwide.},

Methods: We prospectively enrolled 30 treatment-na?ve patients with confirmed COVID-19 after informed consent at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The patients were randomized 1:1 to HCQ group and the control group. Patients in HCQ group were given HCQ 400 mg per day for 5 days plus conventional treatments, while those in the control group were given conventional treatment only. The primary endpoint was negative conversion rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid in respiratory pharyngeal swab on days 7 after randomization. This study has been approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai public health clinical center and registered online (NCT04261517). Results: One patient in HCQ group developed to severe during the treatment. On day 7, COVID-19 nucleic acid of throat swabs was negative in 13 (86.7\%) cases in the HCQ group and 14 (93.3\%) cases in the control group (P{$>$}0.05). The median duration from hospitalization to virus nucleic acid negative conservation was 4 (1-9) days in HCQ group, which is comparable to that in the control group[2 (1-4) days, (U=83.5, P{$>$}0.05)]. The median time for body temperature normalization in HCQ group was 1 (0-2) after hospitalization, which was also comparable to that in the control group 1 (0-3). Radiological progression was shown on CT images in 5 cases (33.3\%) of the HCQ group and 7 cases (46.7\%) of the control group, and all patients showed improvement in follow-up examination. Four cases (26.7\%) of the HCQ group and 3 cases (20\%) of the control group had transient diarrhea and abnormal liver function (P{$>$}0.05). Conclusions: The prognosis of common COVID-19 patients is good. Larger sample size study are needed to investigate the effects of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. Subsequent research should determine better endpoint and fully consider the feasibility of experiments such as sample size.},

Main methods: From February 4 to February 28, 2020, 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 were diagnosed and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ. Key findings: For the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8\% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2\% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years. No difference in the age and sex distribution between the control group and the HCQ group. But for TTCR, the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time were significantly shortened in the HCQ treatment group. Besides, a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6\%, 25 of 32) compared with the control group (54.8\%, 17 of 32). Notably, all 4 patients progressed to severe illness that occurred in the control group. However, there were 2 patients with mild adverse reactions in the HCQ treatment group. Significance: Among patients with COVID-19, the use of HCQ could significantly shorten TTCR and promote the absorption of pneumonia.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We explored the internal structure of within-group variation in the syndemic construct among bisexual adolescents, an understudied and highly vulnerable population known to experience health disparities compared with monosexuals (those attracted to a single gender). We sought to identify patterns of co-occurrence among three domains of high priority behavioral risks-sexual risk factors, substance use, and victimization-and their implications for suicidality., METHOD: We used a national sample of 1,053 ethnically/racially diverse, high school age bisexual adolescents drawn from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). We applied latent class analysis (LCA) to 15 indicators measuring the three aforementioned domains and modeled predictors and an outcome of class membership., RESULTS: Within-group variation in the syndemic construct appears categorical, systematic, and comprised of Low Risk (38\%), Alcohol Use (20\%), Peer-victimization (14\%), Sexually Active (11\%), Syndemic (11\%), and Risk-taking (7\%) classes. Classes were well-separated per classification statistics. The proportions of bisexual identification, sex, and race varied significantly across classes. Syndemic and Peer-victimization classes were equivalent and elevated in their suicidality risk, out of all classes., CONCLUSIONS: Results revealed multiple and diverging forms of conjoint behavioral risk that conferred differential health implications; illuminated the shape and functional form of the syndemic construct among bisexual adolescents; and illustrated the utility of LCA for classifying typologies of risky and normative health behavior patterns. Psychologists are recommended to carefully consider the comorbidly operant nature of behavioral risks in this population. Future directions include addressing replication, multiple-group invariance, additional auxiliary variables, and alternative mixture techniques.

  abstract = {Background: Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO) is rising in incidence, but optimal methods of investigation and duration of antibiotic therapy remain controversial. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of PVO at an Australian teaching hospital. We included all adults with a first episode of PVO between 2006 and 2015. PVO was defined based on the presence of prespecified clinical and radiological criteria. The main exposures of interest were investigation strategy and antibiotic treatment. The main outcome measures were duration of hospital admission, mortality during index admission, symptom resolution during index admission, and attributable readmission within 2 years. Results: Of 129 included patients, 101 (78\%) had a causative organism identified. Patients with an identified pathogen were more likely to be febrile (75\% compared with 29\%, P {$<$} .001) and had a higher mean admission C-reactive protein (207 vs 54, P {$<$} .001) compared with patients without an identified pathogen. However, they were less likely to experience an adverse outcome (death or attributable readmission within 2 years; adjusted odds ratio, 0.36; 95\% confidence interval, 0.13-0.99; P = .04). Open biopsy of vertebral tissue had a higher diagnostic yield (70\%) than fine needle aspirate (41\%) or core biopsy (30\%). Despite receiving a median of 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, only 15\% of patients had a full recovery on discharge from index admission. Conclusions: Clinical outcomes for patients with PVO were poor. Obtaining a microbiological diagnosis is associated with a better outcome. However, prospective and randomized studies are essential to establishing optimal investigation and treatment pathways.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Gonorrhoea and chlamydia cases have been rising among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) over the last decade. The majority of cases are extragenital and occur at the oropharynx and anorectum. The aim of this narrative review was to review the risk factors and mode of transmission for gonorrhoea and chlamydia at the oropharynx and anorectum among MSM. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION New evidence suggests that oropharyngeal gonorrhoea can be transmitted by kissing in addition to through the established route of condomless oral sex; and anorectal gonorrhoea can be acquired when saliva is used as a lubricant for anal sex and rimming in addition to the established route of condomless penile-anal sex in MSM. In contrast, condomless penile-anal sex remains the major route for chlamydia transmission. CONCLUSIONS Substantial transmission of gonorrhoea may occur with practices other than the established routes of condomless oral and/or anal sex and hence condoms may not be effective in preventing gonorrhoea transmission to extragenital sites. In contrast, condoms are effective for chlamydia control because it is mainly transmitted through condomless penile-anal sex. Novel interventions for gonorrhoea that reduce the risk of transmission at extragenital site are required.},

This qualitative, descriptive study explored how trans youth, parents and health care providers engaged or did not engage in shared decision-making practices around hormone therapy initiation and what conditions supported shared decision-making approaches in clinical practice. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 47 participants in British Columbia, Canada, and analyzed using a constructivist grounded theory approach. While formal shared decision-making models were not used in practice, many participants described elements of such approaches when asked about their health care decision-making processes. Others described health care interactions that were not conducive to a shared decision-making approach. The key finding that emerged through this analysis was a set of five conditions for supporting shared decision making when making decisions surrounding initiation of hormone therapy with trans youth. Both supportive relationships and open communication were necessary among participants to support shared decision making. All parties needed to agree regarding what decisions were to be made and what role each person would play in the process. Finally, adequate time was needed for decision-making processes to unfold. When stakeholders meet these five conditions, a gender-affirming and culturally safer shared decision-making approach may be used to support decision making about gender-affirming care. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.},

Transgender (trans) youth experience barriers to needed gender-affirming care, often rooted in ethical and legal issues, such as healthcare provider concerns regarding youth capacity and rights to consent to hormone therapy. Even when decision-making capacity is present, youth may lack the legal authority to give consent. The aims of this paper are therefore to provide an empirical analysis of minor trans youth capacity to consent to hormone therapy and to address the normative question of whether there is ethical justification for granting trans youth the authority to consent to this care. Through qualitative content analysis of interviews with trans youth, parents, and healthcare providers, we found that trans youth demonstrated the understandings and abilities characteristic of the capacity to consent to hormone therapy and that they did consent to hormone therapy with positive outcomes. Employing deontological and consequentialist reasoning and drawing on a foundation of empirical evidence, human rights, and best interests we conclude that granting trans youth with decisional capacity both the right and the legal authority to consent to hormone therapy via the informed consent model of care is ethically justified.},

The aim of this study is to examine the independent associations between economic dependency on a sexual partner and several HIV risk behaviours and sexual health outcomes among YBMSM living in Jackson, Mississippi, USA. Methods: Baseline data from 589 YBMSM, with a median age of 22.0 years (IQR = 15\textendash 25) participating in a brief sex-positive HIV and STI prevention intervention, were used to measure the association between six sexual behaviours, sexually transmissible infections (STIs) status at baseline and economic dependence. Bivariate c2 associations were tested and regression models adjusted for education level (  high school), employment and HIV-status. Results: In regressions, of the six sexual behaviours reported in the last 90 days and six STIs tested at baseline, economically dependent YBMSM were more likely to report condomless anal receptive sex (aOR = 2.19, 95\%CI = 1.25\textendash 3.83),  3 partners as a top (aOR = 1.99, 95\%CI = 1.17\textendash 340),  3 sex partners as a bottom (aOR = 2.07, 95\%CI = 1.24\textendash 3.45),  3 sex acts as a bottom (aOR = 2.10, 95\%CI = 1.16\textendash 3.82) and testing positive for oral gonorrhoea (aOR = 2.39, 95\%CI = 1.18\textendash 4.83) after controlling for HIV status, employment and education. Conclusions: Interventions should consider how poverty, unemployment and economic dependence interact to influence relationship power imbalances, condom use and sexual positioning agency, and sexual health for key populations of MSM.},

Participants\textemdash Participants were sexually active individuals, aged 18 years and older, who reported the genders of their sexual partners in the past 12 months; included 174 homosexually experienced (98 men, 96 women) and 9714 exclusively heterosexually experienced (3922 men, 5792 women) respondents. Measurements\textemdash Life-time, past 30 days and daily use of nine classes of drugs. Symptoms of dysfunctional use and dependence. Findings\textemdash There were consistent patterns of elevated drug use in homosexually experienced individuals for life-time drug use, but these were greatly attenuated for recent use. Homosexually experienced men were more likely to report use of marijuana, cocaine and heroin, and homosexually experienced women more likely to report use of marijuana and analgesics than individuals reporting only opposite-sex partners. Both homosexually active men and women were more likely than exclusively heterosexually active respondents to report at least one symptom indicating dysfunctional drug use across all drug classes, and to meet criteria for marijuana dependence syndrome. The only difference between homosexually experienced men and women was that men were more likely to report any daily drug use.

Given these threats, sexual minorities may engage in sexual orientation concealment in order to avoid danger. This social stigma and minority stress places sexual minorities at risk for anxiety and related disorders. Given that three fourths of anxiety disorder onset occurs before the age of 24, the current study investigated the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression in sexual minority young adults relative to their heterosexual peers. Secondarily, the study investigated sexual orientation concealment as a predictor of anxiety and related disorders. A sample of 157 sexual minority and 157 heterosexual young adults matched on age and gender completed self-report measures of the aforementioned disorders, and indicated their level of sexual orientation concealment. Results revealed that sexual minority young adults reported greater symptoms relative to heterosexuals across all outcome measures. There were no interactions between sexual minority status and gender, however, women had higher symptoms across all disorders. Sexual minority young women appeared to be at the most risk for clinical levels of anxiety and related disorders. In addition, concealment of sexual orientation significantly predicted symptoms of social phobia. Implications are offered for the cognitive and behavioral treatment of anxiety and related disorders in this population.},

  abstract = {This article reviews research on psychosocial and health outcomes associated with peer victimization related to adolescent sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. Using four electronic databases and , we identified 39 relevant studies. These studies were published between 1995 and 2012 and conducted in 12 different countries. The studies were diverse in terms of their approaches to sampling participants, assessing participants' sexual orientation, operationalizing peer victimization, and with regard to the psychosocial and health outcomes studied in relation to peer victimization. Despite the methodological diversity across studies, there is fairly strong evidence that peer victimization related to sexual orientation and gender identity or expression is associated with a diminished sense of school belonging and higher levels of depressive symptoms; findings regarding the relationship between peer victimization and suicidality have been more mixed. Peer victimization related to sexual orientation and gender identity or expression is also associated with disruptions in educational trajectories, traumatic stress, and alcohol and substance use. Recommendations for future research and interventions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Historically, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) health research has focused heavily on the risks for poor health outcomes, obscuring the ways in which LGBTQ populations maintain and improve their health across the life course. In this paper we argue that informing culturally competent health policy and systems requires shifting the LGBTQ health research evidence base away from deficit-focused approaches toward strengths-based approaches to understanding and measuring LGBTQ health. Methods: We recently conducted a scoping review with the aim of exploring strengths-based approaches to LGBTQ health research. Our team found that the concept of resilience emerged as a key conceptual framework. This paper discusses a subset of our scoping review findings on the utility of resilience as a conceptual framework in understanding and measuring LGBTQ health. Results: The findings of our scoping review suggest that the ways in which resilience is defined and measured in relation to LGBTQ populations remains contested. Given that LGBTQ populations have unique lived experiences of adversity and discrimination, and may also have unique factors that contribute to their resilience, the utility of heteronormative and cis-normative models of resilience is questionable. Our findings suggest that there is a need to consider further exploration and development of LGBTQ-specific models and measures of resilience that take into account structural, social, and individual determinants of health and incorporate an intersectional lens. Conclusions: While we fully acknowledge that the resilience of LGBTQ populations is central to advancing LGBTQ health, there remains much work to be done before the concept of resilience can be truly useful in measuring LGBTQ health.},

However, a lack of consensus on scoping review terminology, definition, methodology, and reporting limits the potential of this form of synthesis. In this article, we propose recommendations to further advance the field of scoping review methodology. Study Design and Setting: We summarize current understanding of scoping review publication rates, terms, definitions, and methods. We propose three recommendations for clarity in term, definition and methodology. Results: We recommend adopting the terms "scoping review" or "scoping study" and the use of a proposed definition. Until such time as further guidance is developed, we recommend the use of the methodological steps outlined in the Arksey and O'Malley framework and further enhanced by Levac et al. The development of reporting guidance for the conduct and reporting of scoping reviews is underway. Conclusion: Consistency in the proposed domains and methodologies of scoping reviews, along with the development of reporting guidance, will facilitate methodological advancement, reduce confusion, facilitate collaboration and improve knowledge translation of scoping review findings.},

The databases PubMed and Ovid Medline were searched for studies that were published from January 2011 to March 2016 in English. The following search terms were used: transgender, gender nonconforming, gender minority, gender queer, and gender dysphoria. Age limits included the terms youth, child, children, teenager*, and adolescen*. The combined search produced 654 articles of potential relevance. The resulting abstracts went through a tiered elimination system, and the remaining 15 articles, which presented quantitative data related to the prevalence of transgender youth and their mental health, were included in the present review. In addition to providing new estimates of the number of young people who identify as transgender (.17\%\textendash 1.3\%), studies since 2011 have shown that transgender youth have higher rates of depression, suicidality and self-harm, and eating disorders when compared with their peers. Gender-affirming medical therapy and supported social transition in childhood have been shown to correlate with improved psychological functioning for gender-variant children and adolescents. Recent research has demonstrated increased rates of psychiatric morbidity among transgender youth compared to their peers. Future work is needed to understand those youth who identify as gender nonbinary, improve methods to capture and understand diverse gender identities and related health disparities, and delineate the social determinants of such disparities.},

As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. Results: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization. Safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Syndemics, or the co-occurrence and interaction of health problems, have been examined extensively among young men who have sex with men, but their existence remain unexamined, to our knowledge, among sexual-minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, and bisexual) women. Thus, we investigated if syndemics were present among young sexual-minority women, and if sexual-orientation discrimination was an independent variable of syndemic production. Methods: A total of 467 sexual-minority women between the ages of 18 and 24 completed a cross-sectional online survey regarding their substance use, mental health, sexual behaviors, height, weight, and experiences of discrimination. We used structural equation modeling to investigate the presence of syndemics and their relationship to sexual-orientation discrimination. Results: Heavy episodic drinking, marijuana use, ecstasy use, hallucinogen use, depressive symptoms, multiple sexual partners, and history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) comprised syndemics in this population (chi-square = 24.989, P = .201; comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.946; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.023). Sexual-orientation discrimination is significantly and positively associated with the latent syndemic variable (unstandardized coefficient = 0.095, P {$<$} .05), and this model fit the data well (chi-square = 33.558, P = .059; CFI = 0.914; RMSEA = 0.029). The reverse causal model showed syndemics is not an independent variable of sexual-orientation discrimination (unstandardized coefficient = 0.602, P {$>$} .05). Conclusions: Syndemics appear to be present and associated with sexual-orientation discrimination among young sexual-minority women. Interventions aimed at reducing discrimination or increasing healthy coping may help reduce substance use, depressive symptoms, and sexual risk behaviors in this population.},

Our sample is drawn from the Zzzip survey, and contains 2,280 LGBs, of whom 1,565 are men and 715 are women. The traditional social stress model outlines the influence of general stressors on stress (Pearlin, 1989). Meyer (1995) has expanded Pearlin's model to include the concept of minority stress. This study focuses on aspects of personal characteristics and social structural arrangements. Our study confirms the importance of age and education as relevant determinants for mental health. Additionally, although most research establishes sex differences in depression, this study does not find significant differences in depression between men and women. In women, sexual identity is a significant determinant of depressive score, but we do not find the same in men. Finally, both general and minority stressors, especially the internal stressors, are found to have an important effect on depressive outcomes.},

From this perspective, comorbidity is a (bi)directional relationship between multiple latent variables. We argue that such a latent variable perspective encounters serious problems in the study of comorbidity, and offer a radically different conceptualization in terms of a network approach, where comorbidity is hypothesized to arise from direct relations between symptoms of multiple disorders. We propose a method to visualize comorbidity networks and, based on an empirical network for major depression and generalized anxiety, we argue that this approach generates realistic hypotheses about pathways to comorbidity, overlapping symptoms, and diagnostic boundaries, that are not naturally accommodated by latent variable models: Some pathways to comorbidity through the symptom space are more likely than others; those pathways generally have the same direction (i.e., from symptoms of one disorder to symptoms of the other); overlapping symptoms play an important role in comorbidity; and boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily fuzzy.},

However, as expected, parents' support of their child's sexual orientation, parents' attempts to control their child's sexual orientation, and parents' struggles with their child's sexual orientation were significantly associated with dimensions of youths' identity and psychological adjustment. Parents' gender also moderated the strength of the associations between parental reactions and youths' outcomes.

A total of 5,647 youth (51 \% female, 74 \% White) from 10 schools participated in a cross-sectional anonymous survey, of which 3,745 reported currently being in a dating relationship or having been in one during the prior year. Results indicated that lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth are at higher risk for all types of dating violence victimization (and nearly all types of dating violence perpetration), compared to heterosexual youth. Further, when looking at gender identity, transgender and female youth are at highest risk of most types of victimization, and are the most likely perpetrators of all forms of dating violence but sexual coercion, which begs further exploration. The findings support the development of dating violence prevention programs that specifically target the needs and vulnerabilities of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth, in addition to those of female and transgender youth. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {Objective HIV transmission is ongoing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the UK. Sex without a condom (condomless sex, CLS) is the main risk factor. We investigated the prevalence of and factors associated with types of CLS. Methods Cross-sectional questionnaire study in UK HIV clinics in 2011/2012 (ASTRA). MSM diagnosed with HIV for {$\geq$}3 months reported on anal and vaginal sex, CLS with HIV-serodifferent partners (CLS-D) and CLS with HIV-seroconcordant (CLS-C) partners in the previous 3 months. Mutually exclusive sexual behaviours were as follows: (1) Higher HIV risk CLS-D (not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) or clinic-recorded viral load(VL) {$>$}50 c/mL), (2) Other CLS-D, (3) CLS-C without CLS-D, (4) Condom-protected sex only and (5) No anal or vaginal sex. Associations were examined of sociodemographic, HIV-related, lifestyle, and other sexual measures with the five categories of sexual behaviour. We examined the prevalence of higher HIV risk CLS-D incorporating (in addition to ART and VL) time on ART, ART non-adherence, and recent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Results Among 2189 HIV-diagnosed MSM (87\% on ART), prevalence of any CLS in the past 3 months was 38.2\% (95\% CI 36.2\% to 40.4\%) and that of any CLS-D was 16.3\% (14.8\%\textendash 17.9\%). The five-category classification was as follows: (1) Higher HIV risk CLS-D: 4.2\% (3.5\% to 5.2\%), (2) Other CLS-D: 12.1\% (10.8\% to 13.5\%), (3) CLS-C without CLS-D: 21.9\% (20.2\% to 23.7\%), (4) Condom-protected sex only: 25.4\% (23.6\% to 27.3\%) and (5) No anal or vaginal sex: 36.4\% (34.3\% to 38.4\%). Compared with men who reported condom-protected sex only, MSM who reported any CLS in the past 3 months had higher prevalence of STIs, chemsex-associated drug use, group sex, higher partner numbers, and lifetime hepatitis C. Prevalence of higher HIV risk CLS-D ranged from 4.2\% to 7.5\% according to criteria included. Conclusion CLS was prevalent among HIV-diagnosed MSM, but CLS-D with higher HIV transmission risk was overall low. CLS-D is no longer the most appropriate measure of HIV transmission risk behaviour among people with diagnosed HIV; accounting for VL is important.},

  abstract = {Public voices have largely been absent from the discussions about open access publishing in medical research. Yet the public have a strong interest in ensuring open access of medical research findings because of their roles as funders, advocates, research participants, and patients. By limiting access to research outputs, the current publishing system makes it more difficult for research to be held accountable to the public. Paywalls undermine the work of public advocacy, which requires open access in order to lobby for policy changes and research funding. Research participants generously give their time and energy to research studies with the assumption that the results will be broadly disseminated. Finally, members of the public have a stake in open access publishing as a resource for health information and decision-making. This commentary explores these crucial roles of the public in order to develop a public rationale for open access medical research. We outline a critique of the current academic publishing ecosystem, re-focus the open access debate from a public perspective, and respond to some of the arguments against public open access. Although open access to medical research is not a panacea, removing paywalls and other barriers to public access is essential. The public are critical stakeholders of medical research data.},

Design: This study was performed as part of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence, which is a prospective multicenter cohort study. Setting: Gender clinics in Amsterdam, Ghent, and Florence. Participants: Transwomen who completed the first year of CHT (n = 229). Intervention: CHT. Main Outcome Measures: Breast development in centimeter and cup size. Results: The median age of the included transwomen was 28 years (range, 18 to 69). Mean breastchest difference increased to 7.9 6 3.1 cm after 1 year of CHT, mainly resulting in less than an AAA cup size (48.7\%). Main breast development occurred in the first 6 months of therapy. Serum estradiol levels did not predict breast development after 1 year of CHT (first quartile, 3.6 cm [95\% confidence interval (CI), 2.7 to 4.5], second quartile, 3.2 cm [95\% CI, 2.3 to 4.2], third quartile, 4.4 cm [95\% CI, 3.5 to 5.3], and fourth quartile, 3.6 cm [95\% CI, 2.7 to 4.5]). Conclusion: This study shows that, after 1 year of CHT, breast development is modest and occurs primarily in the first 6 months.

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and associated factors of syndemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) enrolled in the Brazilian pre-exposure prophylaxis demonstration study (PrEP Brasil Study). METHODS: Secondary cross-sectional analysis of the PrEP Brasil Study was performed. Of 450 HIV-seronegative MSM/TGW enrolled in the PrEP Brasil Study- conducted at Rio de Janeiro and S\~ao Paulo, Brazil- 421 participants with complete data were included in the present analysis. Syndemics was defined as occurrence of {$\geq$}2 of the following conditions: polysubstance ({$\geq$}2) use, binge drinking, positive depression screen, compulsive sexual behavior, and intimate partner violence (IPV). RESULTS: The prevalence of recent polysubstance use was 22.8\%, binge drinking 51.1\%, positive depression screening 5.2\%, compulsive sexual behavior 7.1\%, and IPV 7.3\%. Syndemics prevalence was 24.2\%, and associated factors were younger age (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 0.95, 95\% Confidence Interval (95\% CI) 0.92-0.98 per year increase), TGW vs. MSM (aOR 3.09, 95\% CI: 1.2-8.0), some college education or more vs. less than college (aOR 2.49, 95\% CI: 1.31-4.75), and multiple male sexual partners in prior 3 months (aOR 1.69, 95\% CI: 0.92-3.14). CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of syndemics, particularly of polysubstance use and binge drinking, PrEP delivery offers an opportunity to diagnose and intervene in mental and social well-being.},

The aim of this systematic review is to find studies that describe the risk of TTI in MSM blood donors.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cinahl, and Web of Science, and used GRADE for determining evidence quality. We included studies comparing MSM and non-MSM blood donors (or people eligible to give blood), living in areas most relevant for our Blood Service.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Out of 18 987 articles, 14 observational studies were included. Two studies directly compared MSM with non-MSM donors showing that MSM donors have a statistically significant higher risk of HIV-1 infections. In one of these studies it was shown that this was related to recent ({$<$} 12 months) MSM contact. In two additional studies no evidence was shown in favour of a certain deferral period for MSM. Ten studies, applying permanent deferral for MSM, compared infected versus non-infected donors. One study found that MSM is a statistically significant risk factor for HIV-1 infection in blood donors. For other TTI such as HBV or HCV, an increased risk of infection could not be demonstrated, because the precision of the results was affected by the low numbers of donors with MSM as risk factor, or because of risk of bias in the included studies. All studies included low level evidence, because of risk of bias and imprecision of the results.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: High-quality studies investigating the risk of TTI in MSM who donate blood are scarce. The available evidence suggests a link between MSM blood donors and HIV-1 infection, but is too limited to be able to unambiguously/clearly recommend a certain deferral policy.},

Serum levels of sex steroids were assessed in 746 AFAB transgender people during a 3-year follow-up period, starting at the initiation of hormone treatment. Results: Estradiol levels decreased from median [P25\textendash P75] 45.6 [24.0\textendash 102.2] pg/mL to 36.5 [25.0\textendash 46.2] pg/mL over 3 years ( p {$<$} 0.001); a change was already noticeable during the first 3 months (mean \`A17.1 pg/mL, 95\% confidence interval \`A23.8 to \`A10.6, p {$<$} 0.001). Serum estradiol levels were lower in people without endogenous estradiol production from ovarian source (contraceptive users or post hystero-oophorectomy) at baseline and after 3 months, compared with people with endogenous estradiol production. Using long-acting testosterone undecanoate injections resulted in a more prominent decrease in serum estradiol values over 12 months, compared with short-acting mixed testosterone esters ( p {$<$} 0.001) or testosterone gel ( p = 0.001). Changes in serum estradiol were positively correlated to changes in luteinizing hormone (q = 0.107, p {$<$} 0.001) and negatively correlated to changes in follicle-stimulating hormone levels (q = \`A0.167, p {$<$} 0.001) and body mass index (q = \`A0.082, p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion: Testosterone administration in AFAB transgender people resulted in decreasing serum estradiol levels. Our results suggest that testosterone therapy leads to central suppression of estradiol production, with partial restitution due to aromatization.},

It remains uncertain which testosterone preparations most effectively suppress vaginal bleeding and when amenorrhea occurs after testosterone initiation. Aim: To investigate the clinical effects of various testosterone preparations on vaginal bleeding and spotting in transgender men. Methods: This prospective cohort study was part of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence (ENIGI). Data on the persistence and intensity of vaginal bleeding and spotting, serum sex steroid levels and body composition were prospectively and cross-sectionally assessed in 267 transgender men during a three-year follow-up period, starting at the initiation of various testosterone preparations. Results: After three months of testosterone, 17.9\% of transgender men reported persistent vaginal bleeding and 26.8\% reported spotting. The percentages reporting vaginal bleeding and spotting decreased over the first year of testosterone (bleeding 4.7\% and spotting 6.9\% at 12 months, respectively), with no participants reporting vaginal bleeding or spotting after 18 months of testosterone. Factors associated with vaginal bleeding or spotting included lower serum testosterone levels and being on testosterone gel as compared to injections (e.g., esters or undecanoate preparations). If vaginal bleeding persisted, starting progestogens at three months resulted in a decrease in the intensity of vaginal bleeding and spotting. Discussion: Transgender men and hormone-prescribing providers can be reassured that vaginal bleeding and spotting usually stop within three months after testosterone initiation. If not, serum testosterone levels should be measured and testosterone dose adjusted to achieve serum testosterone levels in the physiologic male range. Adding a progestin can be considered after three to six months if bleeding persists. Providers should be aware that cessation of bleeding can be more difficult to achieve in transgender men with lower serum testosterone levels or those on testosterone gel.},

Local AIDS help centres and gay advice centres are recording an increase in drug use among MSM clients in Germany. This study examines reasons for drug use and drug use contexts for MSM, including syndemic factors and experiences of social support. Methods: The study is based on a qualitative research approach. We conducted 14 structured, in-depth interviews with substance-using MSM in three German cities. An interview guidance document was used that was developed on the basis of the syndemic approach. Data analysis was based on structured analysis of content. Results: The MSM interviewed had extensive experience of drug use, in particular amyl nitrate, amphetamines, methamphetamine, ketamine, cocaine and cannabis. The drugs were used both at parties and in connection with sexual experiences (chemsex). Twelve men said that they had an existing HIV infection at the time of the interview. The men also reported experiences of violence and discrimination because of their sexual orientation. The social networks of the MSM and dating apps are highly relevant for experiencing chemsex. Certain places in the MSM community also have an impact on drug purchase, drug consumption and chemsex sessions. Conclusions: MSM are a group that is vulnerable to psychological problems, in particular problematic drug use. This group requires specific help from drug services and AIDS support services that are orientated towards the life situation and substance use contexts of the clients. Both support systems should work together more closely and network. Furthermore, specific prevention strategies, aimed at both mental and physical well-being, should be developed for substance-using MSM.},

Both conditions incur significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the prognosis of COPD and HF combined is poorer than for either disease alone. Nevertheless, usually only one of them is diagnosed. An active search for each condition using clinical examination and additional tests including plasma natriuretic peptides, lung function testing, and echocardiography should be obtained. The combination of COPD and HF presents many therapeutic challenges. The beneficial effects of selective {$\beta$}1-blockers should not be denied in stable patients who have HF and coexisting COPD. Additionally, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers may reduce the morbidity and mortality of COPD patients. Moreover, caution is advised with use of inhaled {$\beta$}2-agonists for the treatment of COPD in patients with HF. Finally, noninvasive ventilation, added to conventional therapy, improves the outcome of patients with acute respiratory failure due to hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD or HF in situations of acute pulmonary edema. The establishment of a combined and integrated approach to managing these comorbidities would seem an appropriate strategy. Additional studies providing new data on the pathogenesis and management of patients with COPD and HF are needed, with the purpose of trying to improve quality of life as well as survival of these patients.},

Here, using an in vitro model of HIV-infected quiescent CD4 T cells, we reveal a gene expression signature of 103 upregulated genes that are specific for latently infected cells, including genes for 16 transmembrane proteins. In vitro screening for surface expression in HIV-infected quiescent CD4 T cells shows that the low-affinity receptor for the immunoglobulin G Fc fragment, CD32a, is the most highly induced, with no detectable expression in bystander cells. Notably, productive HIV-1 infection of T-cell-receptor-stimulated CD4 T cells is not associated with CD32a expression, suggesting that a quiescence-dependent mechanism is required for its induction. Using blood samples from HIV-1-positive participants receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy, we identify a subpopulation of 0.012\% of CD4 T cells that express CD32a and host up to three copies of HIV DNA per cell. This CD32a + reservoir was highly enriched in inducible replication-competent proviruses and can be predominant in some participants. Our discovery that CD32a + lymphocytes represent the elusive HIV-1 reservoir may lead to insights that will facilitate the specific targeting and elimination of this reservoir. Resting CD4 T cells are paradoxically non-permissive to HIV-1, but also predominantly support viral persistence under antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected participants 1,4\textendash 6 . We took advantage of our recent discovery that SAMHD1 is responsible for HIV-1 restriction in resting CD4 T cells to generate latently infected cells without delivering an activation signal 7\textendash 12 . We could thus test the hypothesis that these latently infected non-stimulated T cells might have a gene expression signature that distinguishes them from their non-infected counterparts.

Patients often seek information on genderaffirming medical care using the Internet. Patients who are better informed about their own care may receive better care. This study evaluated the quantity and quality of online information about HT using several existing and novel measures. Methods: Structured Google searches were conducted. Sites were evaluated using previously described Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), DISCERN, and Health On the Net (HON) criteria, for citation of the Endocrine Society Guidelines and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care (SOC), and other topic-specific measures. Results: Forty sites were evaluated. The median JAMA score was 3.5/7, and the median DISCERN score was 51/ 80. No sites held HON certification. Citation of the Endocrine Society Guidelines and the WPATH SOC was inconsistent. Institutional sites had higher DISCERN scores compared with other sites. The presence of a bibliography was most associated with measures of quality. Conclusion: The quality of online information about HT is inconsistent and limited in quantity. Development of reliable online resources on HT for transgender patients is essential. Broadening awareness of key guidelines from the Endocrine Society and WPATH is essential.},

  abstract = {Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States experience a disproportionate and growing HIV burden. In spite of germinal studies and recent advances reported in the scientific literature, there is a noteworthy gap in our understanding of the factors that influence HIV transmission and acquisition among Latino MSM. The goal of this dissertation is to explore how cultural, spatial, and syndemic contexts influence two HIV-related risk behaviors among Latino MSM: serodiscordant condomless anal intercourse (SDCAI) and number of male causal partners. Specifically, I aimed to assess the how acculturation, neighborhood characteristics, and co-occurring epidemics may each contribute to HIV-related risk among Latino MSM. For this project, I utilized data from the NYCM2M study (R01 HD059729; PI: B. Koblin), a cross-sectional study of the relations among neighborhood environmental characteristics, sexual risk behaviors, anxiety and depression, and alcohol and substance use among urban MSM. First, I examined the association between indices of acculturation and the two HIV-related risk behavior outcomes, in addition to assessing if acculturation moderates the influence of sexual minority stressors and peer condom use norms on those same outcomes. The results indicated that relationships between the two sexual minority stressors and SDCAI were strongest among two groups: English-speaking and foreign-born Latino MSM, groups considered to be high and low, respectively, on acculturation. Second, I examined the ethnicity- and gay-related neighborhood correlates of the HIV-related risk behavior outcomes. The results showed that living in areas with a higher proportion of men reporting experiences of ethnicity-based discrimination and higher levels of gay community connectedness were both associated with an increased likelihood of engaging with 5 or more casual sexual partners, while living in an area with a higher foreign-born population was associated with a lower likelihood of the same. Third, I examined both established and population-relevant syndemic conditions to assess the association between syndemic burden and the HIV-related risk behavior outcomes among Latino MSM, and assessed if outness moderated these potential relationships. The results indicated a significant, positive association between the number of syndemic conditions and SDCAI, but, upon testing for moderation, this relationship only existed among men with high levels of outness about their sexual orientation. The results also showed that having any syndemic conditions, regardless of the number, was associated with having more casual sexual partners. Overall, this dissertation highlights the importance of studying HIV-related risk behaviors through multiple contextual lenses among Latino MSM. Specifically, the results suggest a strong need to attend to how cultural factors, spatial environments, and syndemic factors may shape HIV burden among Latino MSM. Taken together, these studies provide evidence for the development of multi-level, multicomponent HIV-reducing interventions that specifically target the differing needs among subgroups of Latino MSM, rather than treating them as a single, monolithic group for study and intervention.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the risk of attempted suicide among sexual minority adolescents, differentiating for each sexual minority group. DATA SOURCES Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO) were searched for articles published through April 30, 2017, with the following search terms: heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, transgender, adolescents, teens, and attempted suicide. STUDY SELECTION Studies that reported attempted suicide in sexual minority adolescents compared with heterosexual peers were included. Thirty-five studies satisfied criteria for inclusion of 764 records identified. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Pooled analyses were based on odds ratios (ORs), with relevant 95\% CIs, weighting each study with inverse variance models with random effects. Risk of publication bias and analysis of heterogeneity through univariable and multivariable meta-regressions were also rated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The evaluation of increased odds of attempted suicide among sexual minority youths compared with heterosexual peers. RESULTS Thirty-five studies reported in 22 articles that involved a total of 2 378 987 heterosexual and 113 468 sexual minority adolescents (age range, 12-20 years) were included in the analysis. Sexual minority youths were generally at higher risk of attempted suicide (OR, 3.50; 95\% CI, 2.98-4.12; c2 = 3074.01; P {$<$} .001; I2 = 99\%). If estimated in each sexual minority group, the OR was 3.71 in the homosexual group (95\% CI, 3.15-4.37; c2 = 825.20; P {$<$} .001; I2 = 97\%) and 4.87 in the bisexual group (95\% CI, 4.76-4.98; c2 = 980.02; P {$<$} .001; I2 = 98\%); transgender youths were described as an individual group in only 1 study, which reported an OR of 5.87 (95\% CI, 3.51-9.82). Meta-regressions weighted for the study weight highlighted that the presence of young participants (12 years old) was associated with heterogeneity in the bisexual group, whereas the year of sampling was associated with heterogeneity in the whole group when combined with other covariates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our findings suggest that youths with nonheterosexual identity have a significantly higher risk of life-threatening behavior compared with their heterosexual peers. Public awareness is important, and a careful evaluation of supportive strategies (eg, support programs, counseling, and destigmatizing efforts) should be part of education and public health planning.},

However, anandamide and 2-AG, and also the phytocannabinoids, have more molecular targets than just CB1R and CB2R. Furthermore, the endocannabinoids, like most other lipid mediators, have more than just one set of biosynthetic and degrading pathways and enzymes, which they often share with "endocannabinoid-like" mediators that may or may not interact with the same proteins as {$\Delta$}(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and other phytocannabinoids. In some cases, these degrading pathways and enzymes lead to molecules that are not inactive and instead interact with other receptors. Finally, some of the metabolic enzymes may also participate in the chemical modification of molecules that have very little to do with endocannabinoid and cannabinoid targets. Here, we review the whole world of ligands, receptors, and enzymes, a true "endocannabinoidome", discovered after the cloning of CB1R and CB2R and the identification of anandamide and 2-AG, and its interactions with phytocannabinoids.},

The study goal was to investigate how bisexual and other non-monosexual individuals experience discrimination, understand how they perceive discrimination to affect their health, and examine the ways in which they cope with discrimination by analyzing responses to open-ended survey questions. The sample included 442 bisexual and other non-monosexual adults, ages 18\textendash 68 years (M\,=\,28.97, SD\,=\,10.30), who either reported a bisexual identity or reported attractions to more than one gender. Gender identities included women (n\,=\,347), men (n\,=\,42), and transgender/non-binary individuals (n\,=\,53); 29\% of participants were currently located outside of the U.S. Participants completed an online survey, including three open-ended questions regarding their experiences with discrimination, how discrimination affects their health, and methods used to cope with discrimination. Themes related to perceived discrimination included: double discrimination of bisexuals and other non-monosexual individuals by heterosexuals, lesbian and gay individuals; bisexual invalidation and erasure; and sexual victimization. Themes related to the perceived effects of discrimination on health included: impact on mental health; impact on physical health; and effect of discrimination in healthcare. Themes related to coping with discrimination included: social support; resilience; and identity-specific media consumption. Findings demonstrate that bisexual and other non-monosexual individuals' experiences of discrimination can be additive, based on other marginalized facets of identity, including race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status. Our findings have implications for advancing bisexual health research from an intersectionality framework.},

  abstract = {Purpose\hspace{0.6em} Homosexuality is a clear risk factor for disordered eating in men; however, for women, research has yielded contradictory results. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the association between sexual orientation and disordered eating in women. Methods\hspace{0.6em} PRISMA guidelines were used. Studies comparing disordered eating between lesbians and heterosexual women were identified using PsycNet database and Google Scholar. Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. Overall disordered eating, restricting, binging and purging were examined for heterosexual, lesbian, bisexual and `mostly heterosexual' women. Results\hspace{0.6em} Whereas there was no significant difference in overall disordered eating between lesbians and heterosexual women, lesbians reported restricting less and binging more than heterosexual women. Bisexual women were more likely than lesbian women to restrict food intake and purge, and more likely than heterosexual women to have overall disordered eating and restrict food intake. ``Mostly heterosexual'' women were more likely than heterosexual women to restrict food intake, binge and purge. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Women of different sexual orientations show distinct patterns of disordered eating. Bisexual and ``mostly heterosexual'' women appear to be particularly at risk. Stress resulting from binegativity and rigid views of sexuality in a dichotomous society, rather than sexual orientation itself, may be associated with disordered eating in women. Findings should be viewed with caution because there were few studies with bisexual and ``mostly heterosexual'' women. This study elucidates the nature of the association between disordered eating and sexual orientation. Findings provide a possible explanation for previous inconsistencies, since opposing trends for different behaviors cancel each other out.},

  abstract = {Medical anthropologists have recently introduced the term " syndemic " to explain the synergistic interaction of two or more diseases and the social situations in which these diseases develop (Singer 2003). The term syndemic is a portmanteau of " synergy " and " epidemic " , " pandemic " and " endemic " . Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally, lends itself to examination using the syndemics framework. In this paper, the concept of syndemics were defined and the importance of this concept was demonstrated. Next, examples of syndemics were outlined and the application of the concept to studying HIV was highlighted. The advantages and limitations of this theoretical framework were also explored. The integrity of the concept of syndemics was examined as it has been applied to varying HIV syndemics. Finally, the utility and applicability of HIV syndemics theory was examined in the context of HIV prevention programs and public health practices. All of these serve to highlight the importance of syndemics theory as a valuable and underused perspective with which to tackle the global problem of HIV. CURRENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF HIV SYNDEMICS Syndemics theory is a valuable but underused tool in the public health fight against HIV. To establish this claim, we will first define syndemics. We will then outline this theory's applicability to HIV public health interventions and establish both its values and limitations in these contexts. By doing so, we hope to highlight the value of syndemics to HIV public health interventions.},

  abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programmes were first implemented in several countries worldwide in 2007. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the population-level consequences and herd effects after female HPV vaccination programmes, to verify whether or not the high efficacy reported in randomised controlled clinical trials are materialising in real-world situations. Methods: We searched the Medline and Embase databases (between Jan 1, 2007 and Feb 28, 2014) and conference abstracts for time-trend studies that analysed changes, between the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods, in the incidence or prevalence of at least one HPV-related endpoint: HPV infection, anogenital warts, and high-grade cervical lesions. We used random-effects models to derive pooled relative risk (RR) estimates. We stratified all analyses by age and sex. We did subgroup analyses by comparing studies according to vaccine type, vaccination coverage, and years since implementation of the vaccination programme. We assessed heterogeneity across studies using I 2 and {$\chi$} 2 statistics and we did trends analysis to examine the dose-response association between HPV vaccination coverage and each study effect measure. Findings: We identified 20 eligible studies, which were all undertaken in nine high-income countries and represent more than 140 million person-years of follow-up. In countries with female vaccination coverage of at least 50\%, HPV type 16 and 18 infections decreased significantly between the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods by 68\% (RR 0{$\cdot$}32, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}19-0{$\cdot$}52) and anogenital warts decreased significantly by 61\% (0{$\cdot$}39, 0{$\cdot$}22-0{$\cdot$}71) in girls 13-19 years of age. Significant reductions were also recorded in HPV types 31, 33, and 45 in this age group of girls (RR 0{$\cdot$}72, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}54-0{$\cdot$}96), which suggests cross-protection. Additionally, significant reductions in anogenital warts were also reported in boys younger than 20 years of age (0{$\cdot$}66 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}47-0{$\cdot$}91]) and in women 20-39 years of age (0{$\cdot$}68 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}51-0{$\cdot$}89]), which suggests herd effects. In countries with female vaccination coverage lower than 50\%, significant reductions in HPV types 16 and 18 infection (RR 0{$\cdot$}50, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}34-0{$\cdot$}74]) and in anogenital warts (0{$\cdot$}86 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}79-0{$\cdot$}94]) occurred in girls younger than 20 years of age, with no indication of cross-protection or herd effects. Interpretation: Our results are promising for the long-term population-level effects of HPV vaccination programmes. However, continued monitoring is essential to identify any signals of potential waning efficacy or type-replacement. Funding: The Canadian Institutes of Health Research.},

We hypothesized that multiple interconnections among psychosocial health conditions would be found among these men, defining syndemic conditions. Constituents of syndemic conditions measured included reported depression symptoms, sexual compulsiveness, substance use, intimate partner violence (IPV), and stress. We found significant evidence of syndemics among these black men: depression symptoms were independently associated with sexual compulsiveness (odds ratios [OR]: 1.88, 95\% CI\,=\,1.1, 3.3) and stress (OR: 2.67, 95\% CI\,=\,1.5, 4.7); sexual compulsiveness was independently associated with stress (OR: 2.04, 95\% CI\,=\,1.2, 3.5); substance misuse was independently associated with IPV (OR: 2.57, 95\% CI\,=\,1.4, 4.8); stress independently was associated with depression symptoms (OR: 2.67, 95\% CI\,=\,1.5, 4.7), sexual compulsiveness (OR: 2.04, 95\% CI\,=\,1.2, 3.5) and IPV (OR: 2.84, 95\% CI\,=\,1.6, 4.9). Moreover, men who reported higher numbers of syndemic constituents (three or more conditions) reportedly engaged in more unprotected anal intercourse compared to men who had two or fewer health conditions (OR: 3.46, 95\% CI\,=\,1.4-8.3). Findings support the concept of syndemics in black MSM and suggest that syndemic theory may help explain complexities that sustain HIV-related sexual transmission behaviors in this group.},

We hypothesized that the convergence of syndemic factors would differ between groups and predict sexual risk and subsequent incident STI., RESULTS: For BMSMO who had a high sexual risk profile, the syndemic factors characterizing this group included perceived racism, incarceration, intimate partner violence, depression, and binge drinking. For BMSMW with a high sexual risk profile, the syndemic factors that characterized this group were incarceration, depression, and binge drinking., CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis highlights syndemic profiles that differentiated BMSMO and BMSMW from one another and supports the need for tailored interventions that address specific syndemic factors for both subpopulations of black men who have sex with men.},

However, little is known about the sexual risk histories of men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW). Furthermore, we know very little about the psychosocial health needs or of the possibility of a syndemic (numerous interrelated epidemics) among MSMW. We surveyed 1,203 men attending drinking establishments in a township located in Cape Town, South Africa. We compared the behaviors and experiences of MSMW to men reporting only having sex with women (MSW). Twelve percent of the sample reported having sex with both men and women in the past 4 months. MSMW were twice as likely as MSW to report being HIV positive (10.5 vs. 4.6 \%). MSW were more likely to be married than MSMW but reported similar numbers of female sex partners. MSMW were more likely to report a history of childhood sexual abuse, recent experienced and perpetrated physical and sexual partner violence, both receiving and giving sex for money, drugs, or shelter, and a recent STI. These factors were found to be interrelated among MSW but not MSMW. Although MSMW demonstrate considerable risk taking and report higher rates of HIV infection than MSW, their needs are largely unmet and underemphasized. Findings suggest the need to better understand factors contributing to sexual risk taking among MSMW. HIV prevention interventions should consider psychosocial health problems unique to MSMW residing in South African townships.},

The first study, using cross-sectional data, looked at migration of MSM to the gay resort area of South Florida, and found that amount of time lived in the area was associated with risk behaviors and HIV infection. The second study, using qualitative interviews, observed complex interactions between neighborhood-level social environments and individual-level racial and sexual identity among MSM in New York City. The third study, using egocentric network analysis with a sample of African American MSM in Baltimore, found that sexual partners were more likely to be found through face-to-face means than the Internet. They also observed that those who co-resided with a sex partner had larger networks of people to depend on for social and financial support, but had the same size sexual networks as those who did not live with a partner. Overall, these findings suggest the need for further investigation into the role of macro-level social forces on the emotional, behavioral, and physical health of urban MSM.},

A scale developed specifically for this study had 10 items related to general health literacy and 10 items related to LGB-specific health information and skills. Factor analysis revealed that the two subscales were distinct and internally consistent, and accounted for 66\% of the variance. Higher LGB health literacy was associated with greater likelihood of coming out to the healthcare provider, reporting better overall health, and having healthcare providers who were knowledgeable about LGBT issues. Greater age was associated with lower general health literacy, but was not associated with LGB literacy. Respondents who had worked in healthcare settings had higher levels of both LGB and general health literacy.

  abstract = {We introduce the network model as a formal psychometric model, conceptualizing the covariance between psychometric indicators as resulting from pairwise interactions between observable variables in a network structure. This contrasts with standard psychometric models, in which the covariance between test items arises from the influence of one or more common latent variables. Here, we present two generalizations of the network model that encompass latent variable structures, establishing network modeling as parts of the more general framework of structural equation modeling (SEM). In the first generalization, we model the covariance structure of latent variables as a network. We term this framework latent network modeling (LNM) and show that, with LNM, a unique structure of conditional independence relationships between latent variables can be obtained in an explorative manner. In the second generalization, the residual variance\textendash covariance structure of indicators is modeled as a network. We term this generalization residual network modeling (RNM) and show that, within this framework, identifiable models can be obtained in which local independence is structurally violated. These generalizations allow for a general modeling framework that can be used to fit, and compare, SEM models, network models, and the RNM and LNM generalizations. This methodology has been implemented in the free-to-use software package lvnet, which contains confirmatory model testing as well as two exploratory search algorithms: stepwise search algorithms for low-dimensional datasets and penalized maximum likelihood estimation for larger datasets. We show in simulation studies that these search algorithms perform adequately in identifying the structure of the relevant residual or latent networks.

  abstract = {Recent years have seen an emergence of network modeling applied to moods, attitudes, and problems in the realm of psychology. In this framework, psychological variables are understood to directly affect each other rather than being caused by an unobserved latent entity. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to estimating the most popular network model for psychological data: the partial correlation network. We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure in psychological data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on post-traumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the effect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to determine the required sample size for a network analysis, and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems that can arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.},

  abstract = {HIV is still a significant public health problem in the EU/EEA. In 2015, 29 747 new HIV infections were diagnosed in the EU/EEA, and the rate of new infections has not declined significantly over the last decade. An estimated 810 000 persons were living with HIV in the EU/EEA in 2015 (0.2\% of the adult population), however the prevalence is much higher in some countries and among key populations. Men who have sex with men are the key population within which new infections continue to increase. Migrants also remain disproportionately affected and although some of them are infected prior to arriving in the country where they are diagnosed, there is growing evidence that sub-groups are at risk of acquiring HIV after arrival in the EU/EEA. Coverage and uptake of prevention interventions is insufficient to reduce the number of new HIV infections. Two out of three EU/EEA countries report that the funds available for prevention are insufficient to reduce the number of new HIV infections. Coverage of key prevention interventions, including condom promotion and distribution, behaviour change inter-ventions, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and harm reduction for people who inject drugs remains too low in many countries to make a real impact. A significant proportion of people living with HIV infection in the EU/EEA have not been diagnosed and, among those diagnosed, nearly half are diagnosed late. Based on data reported by 20 countries, 17\% of people living with HIV are estimated to have not yet been diagnosed. When surveillance data reported from all 31 EU/EEA countries is modelled, this proportion was estimated at 15\% in 2015. In 2015, 47\% of all reported cases with information on their CD4 cell count at the time of diagnosis were diagnosed late ({$<$}350 cells/ mm 3), leading to higher healthcare costs and increasing the duration of possible HIV transmission. The high proportions of people with HIV who do not know their status or who are diagnosed late reflect insufficient testing, gaps in testing services or services not reaching those most at risk. Treatment overall starts earlier and more people get treated. But one in six people in the EU/ EEA diagnosed with HIV are still not on treatment. The number of EU/EEA countries reporting that treatment is now initiated regardless of the CD4 cell count increased from four in 2014 to 24 in 2016. This policy has led to encouraging increases in the number of people on antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, based on data reported by 25 countries in 2016, 17\% of people with HIV who have been diagnosed are still not receiving ART. Reasons for this include outdated treatment threshold policies, legal and policy barriers, health system resource challenges and social and cultural factors. Undocumented migrants face particular difficulties in accessing HIV treatment, with half of the EU/EEA countries not providing treatment for this population. Almost 9 out of 10 people living with HIV who are on treatment are virally suppressed. Based on data reported by 20 countries in 2016, 89\% of people receiving treatment are virally suppressed, but this proportion varies among countries, ranging from 51\textendash 95\%. The proportion of people living with HIV who are virally suppressed out of the total population of people living with HIV, is far lower (around 59\%) but again, this varies considerably among countries. Priorities for action. To reduce the number of new HIV infections in Europe, prevention efforts need to be prioritised alongside an uptake of HIV testing and easier access to treatment.},

Conference proceedings between 2001 and 2019.Eligibility criteria for selecting studiesRandomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia in adult participants (age {$\geq$}18 years). Strategies of interest were prompt endoscopy; test for Helicobacter pylori and perform endoscopy in participants who test positive; test for H pylori and eradication treatment in those who test positive ("test and treat"); empirical acid suppression; or symptom based management. Trials reported dichotomous assessment of symptom status at final follow-up ({$\geq$}12 months).ResultsThe review identified 15 eligible randomised controlled trials that comprised 6162 adult participants. Data were pooled using a random effects model. Strategies were ranked according to P score, which is the mean extent of certainty that one management strategy is better than another, averaged over all competing strategies. "Test and treat" ranked first (relative risk of remaining symptomatic 0.89, 95\% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.02, P score 0.79) and prompt endoscopy ranked second, but performed similarly (0.90, 0.80 to 1.02, P score 0.71). However, no strategy was significantly less effective than "test and treat." Participants assigned to "test and treat" were significantly less likely to receive endoscopy (relative risk v prompt endoscopy 0.23, 95\% confidence interval 0.17 to 0.31, P score 0.98) than all other strategies, except symptom based management (relative risk v symptom based management 0.60, 0.30 to 1.18). Dissatisfaction with management was significantly lower with prompt endoscopy (P score 0.95) than with "test and treat" (relative risk v "test and treat" 0.67, 0.46 to 0.98), and empirical acid suppression (relative risk v empirical acid suppression 0.58, 0.37 to 0.91). Upper gastrointestinal cancer rates were low in all trials. Results remained stable in sensitivity analyses, with minimal inconsistencies between direct and indirect results. Risk of bias of individual trials was high; blinding was not possible because of the pragmatic trial design.Conclusions"Test and treat" was ranked first, although it performed similarly to prompt endoscopy and was not superior to any of the other strategies. "Test and treat" led to fewer endoscopies than all other approaches, except symptom based management. However, participants showed a preference for prompt endoscopy as a management strategy for their symptoms.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO registration number CRD42019132528.},

Interest in the health outcomes of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants has grown in the past decade, with several studies suggesting that these infants have increased mortality rates, increased infectious morbidity, and impaired growth compared with HIV-unexposed infants. However, heterogeneous results might reflect the inherent challenges in studies of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants, which need large populations with appropriate, contemporaneous comparison groups and repeated HIV testing throughout the period of breastfeeding. We review the effects of HIV exposure on mortality, morbidity, and growth, discuss the immunological abnormalities identified so far, and provide an overview of interventions that could be effective in this susceptible population. As the number of infants infected with HIV declines, the health needs of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants should be prioritised further, to ensure that post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals are achieved.},

Limited data is available on chemsex outside major cities. The current study investigated the use of a wide variety of drugs during sex among MSM living outside major cities in the Netherlands and their associations with STI. Methods In 2018, 350 MSM were recruited at STI clinics and 250 MSM completed an online questionnaire. Questionnaire data were linked to clients' most recent STI laboratory test results. Chemsex was defined as using cocaine, crystal meth, designer drugs, GHB/GBL, ketamine, speed, or XTC/MDMA during sex in the preceding six months. The use of other drugs was also assessed. Determinants (chemsex, specific drugs, number of drugs, combining, and frequency) potentially associated with STI were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and sexual history. Results Chemsex was reported by 35\% (95\%CI: 29\textendash 41) of the 250 participants. XTC/MDMA (27\%; 68/250) and GHB/GBL (26\%; 64/250) were the most used drugs. STI positivity was 33\% (29/87) in MSM engaging in chemsex and 12\% (12/163) in MSM not engaging in chemsex (p{$<$}0.001). Half of MSM engaging in chemsex (45/87) used three of more different chemsex drugs; STI positivity in this group was 44\% (20/45). The only factor independently associated with STI was the use of three or more chemsex drugs (aOR: 4.13, 95\%CI: 1.77\textendash 9.62). Conclusion This study shows that chemsex is prevalent among MSM visiting the STI clinic outside major cities in the Netherlands, suggesting that health services in both urban and non-urban areas should be aware of and informed on chemsex. MSM who used multiple drugs are at particular risk for STI, indicating a special need for STI prevention and care in this group.},

  abstract = {Background: Existing tools for measuring blood-borne virus (BBV) and sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission risk behaviours in substance use interventions have limited capacity to assess risk behaviours across varied social, cultural and epidemiological contexts; have not evolved alongside HIV treatment and prevention innovations; or accounted for sexual contexts of drug use including among a range of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) sub-communities. The Substance Use and Sex Index (SUSI) is a new brief, simple tool being developed to assess change in HIV and STI risk behaviours for substance use treatment studies. Methods: A 26-item questionnaire was piloted online among community volunteers (n = 199). Concurrent and predictive validity were assessed against risk-taking (RT-18) and STI testing items (Gay Community Periodic Surveys). Results: The developed scale comprised nine items measuring: condomless penile (anal or vaginal) sex, unprotected oral sex, shared toy use, bloodplay, chemsex (consumption of drugs for the facilitation of sex), trading sex for drugs, being `too out of it' to protect self, injecting risk and group sex. Factor-analytic approaches demonstrated that items met good fit criteria for a single scale. Significant, moderate magnitude, positive relationships were identified between total SUSI score and both RT-18 risk-taking and recent STI testing. Qualitative feedback underscored the importance of culturally-embedded question formulation. Conclusion: The results support the conceptual basis for the instrument, highlighting the need for further scale content refinement to validate the tool and examine sensitivity to change. SUSI is a step towards improving outcome measurement of HIV/BBV/STI transmission risk behaviours in substance use treatment studies with greater inclusiveness of experiences across different population groups.},

The current study examined gender and sexual orientation differences in willingness to date, have sex with, or be in a relationship with bisexual partners. Participants (N ϭ 801) completed an online survey that included a measure of willingness to engage in romantic and sexual activities with same-gender and different-gender bisexual partners. Results indicated that heterosexuals and lesbians/gay men were less willing than bisexuals to engage in romantic/sexual activities with bisexual partners. Additionally, people were generally less willing to be in a relationship with a bisexual partner than they were to have sex with or to date one. Thus, negative attitudes toward bisexuals appear to extend to people's willingness to engage in romantic/sexual activities with bisexual partners, and such willingness differs as a function of gender and sexual orientation. Efforts are needed to educate people about bisexuality and to dispel myths that contribute to negative attitudes toward bisexuals. Such efforts have the potential to reduce stigma and discrimination toward bisexuals as well as reduce health disparities related to bisexuality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While several studies have demonstrated that gay and bisexual men are at increased risk of suicide less attention has been given to the processes that generate the inherent inequity with the mainstream population. This study tested whether syndemic theory can explain the excess suicide burden in a sample of Canadian gay and bisexual men. Syndemic theory accounts for co-occurring and mutually reinforcing epidemics suffered by vulnerable groups due to the effects of social marginalization. METHODS: This study used data from Sex Now 2011, a cross-sectional survey of Canadian gay and bisexual men (n = 8382). The analysis measured the extent to which anti-gay marginalization and several psychosocial health problems are associated with suicide related ideation and attempts. Since psychosocial health problems were hypothesized to have an additive effect on suicide related ideation and attempts, the analysis calculated the effect of accumulated psychosocial health problems on suicide behavior. RESULTS: Suicide ideation and attempts were positively associated with each individual marginalization indicator (verbal violence, physical violence, bullying, sexual violence and work discrimination) and psychosocial health problems (smoking, party drugs, depression, anxiety, STIs, HIV risk and HIV). Furthermore, prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts increased with each added psychosocial health problem. Those who reported 3 or more had 6.90 (5.47-8.70) times the odds of experiencing suicide ideation and 16.29 (9.82-27.02) times the odds of a suicide attempt compared to those with no psychosocial health problems. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation suggests that syndemics is a useful theory for studying suicide behavior among gay and bisexual men. Moreover, the findings highlight a need to address gay and bisexual men's health problems holistically and the urgent need to reduce this population's experience with marginalization and violence.},

  abstract = {Syndemics (socially produced intertwined epidemics) of psychosocial issues have been shown empirically to increase the risk of HIV infection among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM). However, to intervene effectively identifying those who are most vulnerable is critically important. Using an intersectionality framework, this study analyzed data drawn from 8490 Canadian GBM respondents to an online survey to evaluate demographic factors associated with experiencing a syndemic. A multivariable regression model was used to identify demographic characteristics among those experiencing a syndemic of two or more issues. Then, applying an intersectionality framework, the sample was stratified by gay and bisexual men, and by men partnered with woman (whether they were gay, bisexual or other), and the multivariate analyses for demographic variables were repeated for each strata. Multivariate regression models found that men were more at risk of syndemics if they identified as gay, were single, young ({$<$} 30-years-old), did not have a university degree and were low-income earners ({$<$} \$60,000 per year). On stratified analysis, variations were found between gay, bisexual and female-partnered men where gay men were at greater odds of reporting a syndemic. These results provide further evidence that syndemics of psychosocial issues increase the risk of HIV infection among GBM. More so, the occurrence of syndemics was dependent on every single variable investigated including ethnicity and income. As such, interventions to reduce the effects of syndemics should be targeted to those most at risk and address social and structural inequities.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We applied syndemic theory to explore the degree to which syndemic conditions explain the syphilis epidemic affecting Canadian gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (GBMSM). METHODS: Data from a national survey comprising 7872 GBMSM were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to measure associations between recent syphilis diagnosis (RSD; in previous 12 months) and the following variables: (1) sociodemographic information (sexuality, HIV status, age, income, ethnicity, relationship status), (2) antigay stigma (bullying, physical violence, sexual violence, career discrimination, health care discrimination), (3) syndemic conditions (suicidality, intimate partner violence, depression, illicit substance use, binge drinking), (4) sexual behaviors, (5) health care discrimination, and (6) the cumulative count of antigay experiences and syndemic conditions. RESULTS: Three percent (n = 235) of GBMSM surveyed reported an RSD. Men were more likely to report an RSD if they were HIV positive (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 6.27; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 4.66-8.43). Recent syphilis diagnosis was also positively associated with career discrimination, health care discrimination, substance use, and intimate partner violence. Furthermore, prevalence of RSD increased with each additional form of stigma or syndemic condition. The odds of reporting RSD was 5.2 (95\% CI, 1.0-25.9) times higher for men who reported experiencing all 4 forms of antigay stigma compared with those who reported no stigma, after adjusting for sociodemographics. Similarly, the adjusted odds of reporting RSD was 12.2 (95\% CI, 2.0\%-74.8\%) times higher for GBMSM experiencing 5 syndemic conditions compared with those reporting no syndemic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this large cross-sectional study suggests that the Canadian syphilis epidemic among GBMSM is being driven by a syndemic constituted by multiple social and psychological conditions. Interventions addressing specific psychosocial health outcomes that increase the risk for syphilis should be developed and integrated within targeted sexual health services and syphilis prevention initiatives.},

Four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 12,679; 51.29 \% female) were used with repeated measures latent class analysis to estimate sexual trajectory groups designated by prospective reports of romantic attraction, sexual/romantic behavior, and sexual identity from adolescence to adulthood. Five unique trajectories emerged: two heterosexual groups (heterosexual early daters [58.37 \%] and heterosexual later daters [29.83 \%]) and three sexual minority groups (heteroflexible [6.44 \%], later bisexually identified [3.32 \%], and LG[B] identified [2.03 \%]). These sexual trajectories differentiate risk for depressive symptomology, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and alcohol use during adolescence and early adulthood. Groups where individuals first reported same-sex attraction and sexual minority identities in adulthood (heteroflexible and later bisexually identified) had similar levels of depression, suicidality, and greater substance use than those who largely reported same-sex attraction and behavior during adolescence (the LG[B] identified group). These later recognition groups showed greater risk for poor outcomes in waves where they also first reported these changes in attraction, behaviors, and identities. The emergence of three sexual minority groups reveal within-group differences in sexuality and sexual trajectories and how these experiences relate to risk and timing of risk across the transition to adulthood.},

Because human social and psychological processes typically have an individually variable and time-varying nature, they are unlikely to be ergodic. In this paper, six studies with a repeated-measure design were used for symmetric comparisons of interindividual and intraindividual variation. Our results delineate the potential scope and impact of nonergodic data in human subjects research. Analyses across six samples (with 87\textendash 94 participants and an equal number of assessments per participant) showed some degree of agreement in central tendency estimates (mean) between groups and individuals across constructs and data collection paradigms. However, the variance around the expected value was two to four times larger within individuals than within groups. This suggests that literatures in social and medical sciences may overestimate the accuracy of aggregated statistical estimates. This observation could have serious consequences for how we understand the consistency between group and individual correlations, and the generalizability of conclusions between domains. Researchers should explicitly test for equivalence of processes at the individual and group level across the social and medical sciences.},

Between October 2017 and January 2018, we conducted 27 in-depth interviews with SRH stakeholders, including five TGE individuals who had obtained contraception or abortion care, and 22 clinicians, researchers, and advocates experienced in transgender healthcare. We iteratively developed a codebook and conducted thematic analysis to capture the spectrum of perspectives across interviews. Stakeholders reported a range of barriers to contraception and abortion access for TGE people AFAB, including inability to afford services, lack of gender-affirming clinicians, difficulty obtaining insurance coverage, and misconceptions about fertility and unplanned pregnancy risk. Deterrents to care-seeking included gendered healthcare environments, misgendering, and discrimination. Stakeholders described provider knowledge gaps and a perceived lack of medical education relevant to the SRH needs of TGE people. Recommendations included using gender-inclusive language and gender-affirming patient education materials and improving provider training on gender-affirming SRH care. Stakeholders identified substantial barriers to high-quality contraception and abortion care for TGE AFAB people in the U.S. They recommended specific interventions at the provider and institutional levels to improve experiences with care for TGE people and ensure broader access to gender-affirming SRH services.},

METHODS: We conducted a community-based research project that included an advisory committee of young bisexual women, academic partners, and a community health centre. Four 2-hour focus group sessions were conducted with a total of 35 participants. Data were analyzed through a constructivist grounded theory approach using Nvivo software. RESULTS: Participants' discussion of their sexual and reproductive health indicated that they perceived social marginalization, particularly biphobia and monosexism, as a significant challenge to their health. Participants also discussed their sexual, reproductive and mental health as interconnected. CONCLUSIONS: Young bisexual women in this study perceived their sexual, reproductive and mental health as interconnected and negatively influenced by social marginalization. This perception is in line with syndemic research that illustrates the interrelationship between psychosocial and sexual health. Researchers should further explore the utility of syndemic theory in understanding the complexity of young bisexual women's health.},

Those meeting inclusion criteria were coded for key variables including methodology used, positive and null results, participant characteristics, and specific minority stress processes and biological outcomes considered. In total, 26 studies met inclusion criteria. Studies tested relationships between specific minority stress processes including prejudice, expectations of prejudice, concealment of sexual orientation, and internalized stigma and multiple biological outcomes, such as overall physical health, immune response, HIV specific outcomes, cardiovascular outcomes, metabolic outcomes, cancer related outcomes, and hormonal outcomes. Studies included both analyses that detected this relationship (42\% of analyses) and analyses that did not detect this relationship (58\%). There is substantial evidence to support the relationship between minority stress and biological outcomes, yet additional research is needed to identify the measurements and outcomes that have the most rigorous and replicable results.},

This prospective analysis of longitudinal data collected from an outpatient methamphetamine abuse treatment program for gay and bisexual men assessed whether symptoms of depression mediated and/or moderated the associations between methamphetamine use and unprotected insertive/receptive anal intercourse., METHOD: From November 2005 through October 2007, 167 treatment-seeking gay and bisexual men (63\% HIV-positive) enrolled in and attended a 16-week methamphetamine abuse outpatient treatment program. Participants ' depressive symptoms, biomarker-confirmed methamphetamine use, and self-reported sexual risk taking were assessed at baseline and follow-up evaluations. Path analysis tested the mediating and moderating effects of depression on the associations between methamphetamine use and unprotected insertive/receptive anal intercourse., RESULTS: Methamphetamine use during the treatment period had a significant indirect (Coef. = -.15; 95\% CI [-.23, -.06]), but no direct (Coef. = .11; ns) or total effect (Coef. = -.04; ns) on participants' sexual risk taking after accounting for the significant mediating (Coef. = .56; 95\% CI [.33, .78]) and moderating (Coef. = -.03; 95\% CI [-.04, -.02]) effects of depression., CONCLUSIONS: Depression fully mediated and weakly moderated associations between methamphetamine use and sexual risk taking in this sample.

These 2 variables were used to examine the timing and sequencing of 7 coming-out experiences: first awareness of same-sex attraction; first sexual experiences with opposite-sex partners; first sexual experiences with same-sex partners; self-identification as gay, lesbian, or bisexual; disclosure to someone other than a parent; disclosure to mother; and disclosure to father. The significant effects of age revealed that self-identification in adolescence as opposed to adulthood was associated with an overall young coming-out trajectory for all milestone experiences, which occurred in both earlier and recent historical contexts. Adolescents as opposed to adult self-identifiers were also more likely to demonstrate identity-centered sequences in which self-identification preceded same-sex sexual experiences, and fewer of these individuals had any heterosexual experience. Significant historical context effects indicated recent trends toward younger disclosure of orientation to others and to parents, greater likelihood of an identity-centered sequence, and younger ages for first heterosexual but not same-sex, sexual experiences. Among women, there was a recent trend toward greater likelihood of having a bisexual identity milestone. In general, the maturational effects were independent of historical context, with the exception that only adolescent self-identifiers who came out recently disclosed to others and to parents at an average age younger than 18 years. These developmental and historical trends expand on the stage-sequential framework to show how the process of sexual orientation identity development is driven by maturational factors as well as social changes.},

Data concerning low back pain can be of categorical nature, in form of check-list in which each item denotes presence or absence of a clinical condition. Latent class analysis is a model-based clustering method for multivariate categorical responses which can be applied to such data for a preliminary diagnosis of the type of pain. In this work we propose a variable selection method for latent class analysis applied to the selection of the most useful variables in detecting the group structure in the data. The method is based on the comparison of two different models and allows the discarding of those variables with no group information and those variables carrying the same information as the already selected ones. We consider a swap-stepwise algorithm where at each step the models are compared through an approximation to their Bayes factor. The method is applied to the selection of the clinical criteria most useful for the clustering of patients in different classes. It is shown to perform a parsimonious variable selection and to give a clustering performance comparable to the expert-based classification of patients into three classes of pain.},

Despite this increasing awareness, a paucity of research data and clinical protocols of care for clinicians continues to exist, especially in regard to the transgender individual's family planning needs. Clinicians should be on the forefront of promoting strategies that forge a meaningful and collaborative relationship with the transgender man, including as he transitions through to the menopause and his sexual and reproductive healthcare needs. Unfortunately, despite best efforts to address the health concerns of transgender men in midlife, including their contraceptive needs and pregnancy desires, there is currently a paucity of research. Although hormonal contraceptives are not an option for this group of individuals, especially those on masculinizing hormones, IUD's, both copper containing and progestin containing, should be considered for those with intact pelvic organs. For this group of transgender men with potential for pregnancy who have either completed their family or choose not to give birth, sterilization can be offered. Regardless of where they identify along the gender spectrum, these midlife individuals with potential reproductive potential should have equitable access to and up to date counseling on their contraceptive options. This commentary addresses the contraceptive challenges of the midlife transgender man.

  abstract = {Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect men who have sex with men, with marked increases in most STIs in recent years. These are likely underpinned by coterminous increases in behavioural risks which have coincided with the development of Internet and geospatial sociosexual networking. Current guidelines advocate regular, annual sexually transmitted infection testing amongst sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM), as opposed to symptom-driven testing. This paper explores sexually transmitted infection testing regularity amongst MSM who use social and sociosexual media. Data were collected from 2668 men in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, recruited via social and gay sociosexual media. Only one-third of participants report regular (yearly or more frequent) STI testing, despite relatively high levels of male sex partners, condomless anal intercourse and high-risk unprotected anal intercourse. The following variables were associated with regular STI testing; being more 'out' (adjusted odds ratio = 1.79; confidence interval = 1.20-2.68), HIV-positive (adjusted odds ratio = 14.11; confidence interval = 7.03-28.32); reporting {$>$}=10 male sex partners (adjusted odds ratio = 2.15; confidence interval = 1.47-3.14) or regular HIV testing (adjusted odds ratio = 48.44; confidence interval = 28.27-83.01). Men reporting long-term sickness absence from work/carers (adjusted odds ratio = 0.03; confidence interval = 0.00-0.48) and men aged {$<$}=25 years (adjusted odds ratio = 0.36; 95\% confidence interval = 0.19-0.69) were less likely to test regularly for STIs. As such, we identify a complex interplay of social, health and behavioural factors that each contribute to men's STI testing behaviours. In concert, these data suggest that the syndemics placing men at elevated risk may also mitigate against access to testing and prevention services. Moreover, successful reduction of STI transmission amongst MSM will necessitate a comprehensive range of approaches which address these multiple interrelated factors that underpin MSM's STI testing.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Bisexual older adults are a growing yet largely invisible, underserved, and understudied population. Utilizing the Health Equity Promotion Model, we examined hypothesized mechanisms accounting for health disparities between bisexual older adults and lesbian and gay older adults. Method: Based on data from Caring and Aging with Pride, the largest national survey of LGBT older adults, this study (N = 2,463) utilized structural equation modeling to investigate direct and indirect associations between sexual identity (bisexual vs. lesbian and gay) and health via sexual identity factors (identity disclosure and internalized stigma), social resources, and socioeconomic status (SES). Results: Bisexual older adults reported significantly poorer health compared with lesbian and gay older adults. Indirect effects involving sexual identity factors, social resources, and SES explained the association between bisexual identity and poorer health. A potentially protective pathway was also identified wherein bisexuals had larger social networks after adjusting for other factors. Discussion: Bisexual older adults face distinct challenges and health risks relative to other older adults, likely because of the accumulation of socioeconomic and psychosocial disadvantages across the life course. Interventions taking into account older bisexuals' unique risk and protective factors may be helpful in reducing health inequities.},

  abstract = {Despite the proliferation of research and the application of behavioral interventions, African American/Black men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to bear the greatest burden of reported new cases of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. Previous research has identified numerous socially constructed factors that contribute to the syndemics involved that include HIV infection, substance abuse, and risk taking behaviors that increase health disparities observed in African American/Black MSM. There is evidence that behaviors are, acquired through family and community interactions, messages about sexual identity, gender expectations and life experiences. Social networks both positive and negative have a significant impact on the individual's self-perception and acceptable behavior. The syndemics theory holds relevance in these studies in that there are multiple factors at work in the lives of Black men who have sex with men that contribute to their health disparities. In this study, 10 New York City African American/Black MSM between the ages of 18 and 30 years old were engaged in individual in-depth interviews. The participants described, in detail, their social and sexual experiences beginning with the point at which they self-identified as same gender-loving Black males. Data analyses showed the significance of family acceptance, and social support, and seeking validation in syndemic formation in these subjects. The data further demonstrated that disparities and syndemic formation are dependent upon several reinforcing experiences, not on one single incident.

  abstract = {PUROPSE: A newly emergent literature suggest that bisexual men and women face profound health disparities in comparison to both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Additionally, bisexual individuals often experience prejudice, stigma, and discrimination from both gay/lesbian and straight communities, termed "biphobia." However, only limited research exists that empirically tests the extent and predictors of this double discrimination. The Bisexualities: Indiana Attitudes Survey (BIAS) was developed to test associations between biphobia and sexual identity. METHODS: Using standard techniques, we developed and administered a scale to a purposive online sample of adults from a wide range of social networking websites. We conducted exploratory factor analysis to refine scales assessing attitudes toward bisexual men and bisexual women, respectively. Using generalized linear modeling, we assessed relationships between BIAS scores and sexual identity, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Two separately gendered scales were developed, administered, and refined: BIAS-m (n=645), focusing on attitudes toward bisexual men; and BIAS-f (n=631), focusing on attitudes toward bisexual women. Across scales, sexual identity significantly predicted response variance. Lesbian/gay respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their heterosexual counterparts (all p-values {$<$}.05); bisexual respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their straight counterparts (all p-values {$<$}.001); and bisexual respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their lesbian/gay counterparts (all p-values {$<$}.05). Within racial/ethnic minority respondents, biracial/multiracial status was associated with lower bi-negativity scores (all p-values {$<$}.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides important quantitative support for theories related to biphobia and double discrimination. Our findings provide strong evidence for understanding how stereotypes and stigma may lead to dramatic disparities in depression, anxiety, stress, and other health outcomes among bisexual individuals in comparison to their heterosexual and homosexual counterparts. Our results yield valuable data for informing social awareness and intervention efforts that aim to decrease bi-negative attitudes within both straight and gay/lesbian communities, with the ultimate goal of alleviating health disparities among bisexual men and women.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine associations between intertwining epidemics (syndemics) and HIV medication adherence and viral load levels among HIV-positive MSM and to test whether adherence mediates the relationship between syndemics and viral load. DESIGN: We analysed participant data collected between 2003 and 2009 from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, a prospective HIV/AIDS cohort study in four U.S. cities. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal analyses (repeated measures mixed models) to assess whether differences in viral load levels, undetectable viral load and self-reported HIV medication adherence were associated with count of syndemic conditions (substance use, depression symptoms and sexual risk behaviour, range 0-3), adjusting for race/ethnicity, age and income. Mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modelling and the SAS \%mediate macro. RESULTS: Syndemics count was associated with higher viral loads (P {$<$} 0.0001) and lower adherence (P {$<$} 0.0001). Increased counts of concomitant syndemics were associated with viral load (P {$<$} 0.01), detectable viral load (P {$<$} 0.05) and adherence (P {$<$} 0.001). Black MSM experienced worse outcomes across domains than white MSM (P {$<$} 0.0001) and experienced higher overall rates of syndemics (P {$<$} 0.01). Adherence significantly mediated the relationship between syndemics and viral load, accounting for an estimated 32.3\% of the effect (P {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Effectively lowering viral load levels among MSM has implications for both HIV/AIDS prevention and care. Our findings suggest that integrating substance use interventions, mental healthcare and sexual risk prevention into standard HIV care may be necessary to optimize treatment and Treatment as Prevention (TasP) models.},

  abstract = {Though functional social support has been shown to serve as a protective factor for HIV viral load suppression in other populations, scant research has examined this relationship among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. We assessed characteristics of social support, effects of social support on HIV viral load, and moderation by social support of the relationship between psychosocial indicators of a synergistic epidemic (syndemic) and HIV viral load. We analyzed longitudinal data from HIV-positive MSM using antiretroviral therapy who were enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study between 2002 and 2009 (n = 712). First, we conducted reliability assessments of a one-item social support measure. Then, we conducted a series of generalized longitudinal mixed models to assess our research questions. Moderation was assessed using an interaction term. A three-level (low/medium/high) social support variable demonstrated high reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.72; 95\% CI: 0.70, 0.75). Black and Hispanic MSM reported lower social support than their White counterparts (p {$<$} .0001). Recent sero-conversion was associated with higher social support (p {$<$} .05). Higher numbers of concomitant syndemic indicators (depression, polysubstance use, and condomless anal sex) were associated with lower social support (p {$<$} .0001). Medium and high social support levels were associated with greater viral load suppression and lower viral load means (p {$<$} .0001). Social support moderated the relationships between syndemic and HIV viral load (p {$<$} .05). HIV-positive MSM, particularly those of color, may benefit greatly from interventions that can successfully boost functional social support. Creating strengths-based interventions may also have particularly high impact among HIV-positive MSM with the highest psychosocial burdens.},

Analysts have noted that these racial/ethnic disparities in HIV among MSM exist within the wider context of sexual, mental and physical health disparities between MSM and heterosexuals. The intercorrelation of these adverse health outcomes among MSM, termed syndemics, has been theorized to be socially produced by a heterosexist social system that marginalizes lesbian, gay, bisexual, MSM and other sexual minorities. African American and Latino MSM experience overlapping systems of oppression that may increase their risk of experiencing syndemic health outcomes. In this paper, using data from twenty in-depth qualitative interviews with MSM living in four New York City (NYC) neighborhoods, we present accounts of neighborhood space, examining how space can both physically constitute and reinforce social systems of stratification and oppression, which in turn produce social disparities in sexual health outcomes. By analyzing accounts of emerging sexuality in neighborhood space, i.e. across time and space, we identify pathways to risk and contribute to our understanding of how neighborhood space is experienced by gay men, adding to our ability to support young men as they emerge in place and to shape the social topography of urban areas.

  abstract = {Twin and family studies have shown that same-sex sexual behavior is partly genetically influenced, but previous searches for specific genes involved have been underpowered. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 477,522 individuals, revealing five loci significantly associated with same-sex sexual behavior. In aggregate, all tested genetic variants accounted for 8 to 25\% of variation in same-sex sexual behavior, only partially overlapped between males and females, and do not allow meaningful prediction of an individual's sexual behavior. Comparing these GWAS results with those for the proportion of same-sex to total number of sexual partners among nonheterosexuals suggests that there is no single continuum from opposite-sex to same-sex sexual behavior. Overall, our findings provide insights into the genetics underlying same-sex sexual behavior and underscore the complexity of sexuality. A cross human societies and in both sexes, some 2 to 10\% of individuals report engaging in sex with same-sex partners, either exclusively or in addition to sex with opposite-sex partners (1-4). The biological factors that contribute to sexual preference are largely unknown (5), but genetic influences are suggested by the observation that same-sex sexual behavior appears to run in families (6) and is concordant more often in genetically identical (monozygotic) twin pairs than in fraternal twin pairs or siblings (7). With respect to genetic influences, several questions arise. First, what genes are involved and what biological processes do they affect? Previous reports of genetic variants associated with sexual orientation (8-10) were based on relatively small samples and did not meet current standards of genome-wide significance (P {$<$} 5 \texttimes{} 10 -8). Identification of robustly associated variants could enable exploration of the biological pathways and processes involved in development of same-sex sexual behavior. One hypothesis suggests that sex hormones are involved (11-13), but little direct genetic or biological evidence is available. Second, to what extent are genetic influences the same or different for females and males; behavior, attraction, and identity ; and heterosexuality and different same-sex sexual behaviors (such as bisexuality)? In order to identify genetic variants associated with same-sex sexual behavior and explore its genetic architecture and underlying biology, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of same-sex sexual behavior. Analyses were conducted in the UK Biobank from the United Kingdom and a cohort of research participants from 23andMe, predominantly located in the United States, and replications were performed in three other smaller studies. This study is part of a preregistered research plan (Open Science Framework; https://osf.io/357tn), and we explain our deviations from that plan in (14).},

  abstract = {Background: The Streptococcus bovis group (SBG) is a well-known cause of endocarditis, but its role in osteoarticular infections (OAIs) has not been well described. Methods: We analyzed all patients with OAIs by SBG diagnosed in our hospital (1988-2014). We selected those cases with septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, as defined according to clinical, microbiological, and imaging studies. Identification of the strains was performed by using the API 20 Strep and the GP card of the Vitek 2 system, and confirmed the identification by molecular methods. In addition, we reviewed the literature to select all cases of OAI by SBG during the period 1980-2015. Results: From the 83 cases of OAI included in the analysis (21 from our center and 62 from the literature review), 59 were osteomyelitis (57 of them spondylodiscitis) and 24 were arthritis (2 with associated spondylodiscitis). The mean age was 66.9 years, and 79.2\% of the patients were men. Endocarditis (IE) was associated with 59\% of the cases and this association was greater for osteomyelitis than for arthritis (78.9\% vs. 13.6\%; P = 0.001). OAI was a presenting symptom in 63\% of the cases of IE. Colonoscopy was performed in 64 cases, which detected colorectal neoplasm (CRN) in 46 patients (71.8\%), almost all asymptomatic. Some 69.5\% of these neoplasm were carcinomas or advanced adenomas. The blood cultures were positive in 78.3\% cases. In 45 cases, the S. bovis species was identified; in 82.2\% of the cases the cause was Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. The mortality was 7.2\%, which in no case was attributable to the OAI. Conclusions: OAIs are frequently the initial manifestation of IE caused by SBG. S. gallolyticus causes most of these infections. Echocardiogram and colonoscopy are therefore mandatory, given the species' close association with IE and CRN.},

We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. Patients and methods French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. Results Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. Conclusion},

  abstract = {The disproportionate effect of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV on men who have sex with men (MSM) has received increasing attention. Two related conceptual frameworks, minority stress and syndemic theory, have been proposed for understanding the disproportionate effects of STIs on MSM in the United States. We apply these frameworks in examining the role of risk alcohol drinking, polydrug use, and depressive symptoms on unprotected anal sex among MSM enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). We propose that use of interaction models is one epidemiologic implication of the syndemic and minority stress framework. A beta-binomial model is used to estimate the stability of risk alcohol drinking, depressive symptoms, and polydrug use and to examine factors that affect the concordance of the syndemic factors over time. Using generalized estimating equations (GEE), we estimate: 1) the relation among risk alcohol drinking, polydrug use and symptoms of depression, and 2) the relation between the syndemic factors (risk alcohol drinking, polydrug use, and depressive symptoms) and unprotected anal sex among men enrolled in the MACS. We hypothesize the syndemic factors will be positively associated with one another and that synergistic interactions are present. We observed moderate to high stability of the syndemic factors over time. Race affects the stability of risk alcohol drinking and depressive symptoms, but does not appear to affect the stability of polydrug use in this population. The concordance of polydrug use over repeated measures was affected by enrollment period. Among HIV negative black men, we observed the hypothesized synergistic interaction between risk alcohol drinking and depressive symptoms in estimating the odds ratio of polydrug use. There was heterogeneity in the effect of symptoms of depression on polydrug use by levels of risk drinking among HIV positive black men. Interactions were not present among Hispanic and white men. Among HIV positive black men, there is heterogeneity in the effect of symptoms of depression on unprotected anal sex across levels of risk alcohol drinking. White and Hispanic men did not present with interactions between syndemic factors. Our findings suggest that jointly addressing the treatment of syndemic factors may provide additional support for and help promote safe sexual practice among MSM. Our findings contribute to research on syndemic factors among MSM in the United States. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {HIV remains a critical public health issue facing men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. Young MSM (YMSM) ages 13-34 years account for the greatest number of new HIV infections in MSM, with Black YMSM bearing the highest burden of disease. Sexual risk behaviors (e.g. unprotected sex) continue to be the leading transmission mode for HIV among all YMSM and studies have indicated that these behaviors are associated with a number of psychosocial and environmental factors, including adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), exposure to violence, substance use, and mental health problems. Moreover, recent studies based on the syndemic model of HIV risk have shown that exposure to violence, substance use, mental health problems may interact to increase HIV risk in vulnerable populations, including YMSM. However, the relationships among these risk factors and their association with sexual risk behaviors in YMSM are not yet fully understood. Therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional, quantitative study was to: 1) describe the degree to which YMSM engage in HIV risk behaviors, are exposed to ACEs and other multiple forms of violence, experience mental health problems, and use substances; 2) identify the ACEs and violence exposure, substance use, and mental health problems that significantly predict HIV risk behaviors in Black and White YMSM; and 3) test the indirect (through substance use and mental health pathways) effects of violence exposure on HIV risk behaviors. Data was collected using structured computer-assisted personal interviews from a convenience sample of 168 Black (97) and White (71) YMSM recruited at AIDS service organizations that provide HIV prevention programs and testing for YMSM in the St. Louis and Kansas City metropolitan areas. The current study contributed to knowledge regarding HIV risk behaviors and related syndemic risk factors in service-using YMSM. This study was unique in the assessment of adverse childhood experiences, multiple types of violence exposure, experiences of multiple types of mental health problems, and use of multiple substances in a service-using sample of HIV-negative Black and White YMSM, the populations at highest risk for HIV infection in the US. This study found that a substantial proportion of YMSM are exposed to multiple adverse childhood experiences, intimate partner violence, and community violence, all of which were previously unexplored or understudied in YMSM. Additionally, findings from the study identified unique significant mental health and substance use predictors of unprotected anal sex and number of male sex partners for YMSM when controlling for demographic factors. Further, although relationships between adverse childhood experiences or intimate partner violence and HIV risk behaviors were not significant in multiple regression models, this study demonstrated that adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence indirectly affect HIV risk behaviors through polydrug use, whereby higher rates of violence exposure lead to more polydrug use, which leads to a higher rate of multiple male sex partners. The results of this study have implications for social work practice and policy changes that lead to integration of mental health and substance use screening and referral into AIDS service organization that provide HIV prevention services. Moreover, results can be used by researchers to adapt theoretical models of HIV risk and prevention for YMSM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

While HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Vietnam has received increasing attention, most studies focus on HIV knowledge and established risk factors such as injection drug use. This paper proposes to address HIV risk among MSM from an integrated approach to preventive care that takes into account syndemic conditions such as substance use, mental health, and stigma, the latter of which prevents MSM from accessing health services. Method. Current studies related to MSM in Vietnam from 2000 onwards, gathered from peer-reviewed as well as non-peer-reviewed sources, were examined. Results . HIV and STI prevalence among MSM varied significantly by location, and yet HIV prevalence has increased significantly over the past few years. Most studies have focused on sexual risk behaviors, paying little attention to the broad spectrum of sexual health, including noninjecting drug use, heavy alcohol consumption, high rates of mental health distress and anxiety, and stigma. Conclusion . Future research and interventions targeting MSM in Vietnam should address their vulnerability to HIV from an integrated approach that pays attention to both sexual health and syndemic conditions.},

  abstract = {Persons who are transgender (i.e., individuals who are assigned one sex at birth, but who do not identify with that sex) are at elevated risk for developing problematic substance use. Recent studies indicate that transgender persons have high rates of alcohol use, illicit drug use, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs and evince more severe misuse of these substances compared with nontransgender individuals. Despite the high rates of substance use among transgender persons and the multiple conceptual and narrative recommendations for substance use treatments, there is a lack of consensus or awareness of empirically tested interventions and programs effective for this population. Thus, it is critical to examine current substance use interventions for transgender individuals to identify gaps in the field and to immediately put forth efforts to reduce problematic substance use. This systematic review is the first to attempt a comprehensive identification and synthesis of the available evidence on interventions for reducing problematic substance use among transgender persons. Reflective of the state of the field regarding transgender care for substance use, we found a deficiency of studies to include in this systematic review (n=2). Perhaps the most important conclusion of this review is that well-designed, theoretically informed culturally sensitive research focused on developing and rigorously testing interventions for substance use among transgender individuals is alarmingly scarce. This review discusses barriers to intervention design and synthesizes treatment recommendations for future work.},

Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 transgender and nonbinary young adults assigned female sex at birth (ages 22e29 years), recruited via online platforms and community agencies. Semistructured interviews elicited information on participants' gender and reproductive histories, health-care experiences, sexual practices, and contraceptive use and decision-making processes. Interviews were transcribed and coded using thematic analysis. Results: Primary thematic domains centered on contraceptive experiences and needs, testosterone as contraception, and experiences with reproductive health care. Participants generally did not use hormonal contraception to prevent pregnancy; in situations where pregnancy was possible, participants relied on condoms. Some participants believed testosterone use would prevent pregnancy and subsequently did not use a contraceptive method. Participants described the lack of knowledge, among themselves and providers, of the impacts of testosterone on pregnancy risk and interactions with hormonal contraception. They described reproductive health-care experiences in which providers were unfamiliar with the needs of transgender and nonbinary patients; made assumptions about bodies, partners, and identities; and lacked adequate knowledge to provide effective contraceptive care. Conclusions: Patient-centered reproductive care requires that providers be sensitive to the stress of gender-affirming care and engage with contraceptive counseling that addresses patients' behavior, risks, and reproductive functions. In particular, providers should understand and communicate the impacts of testosterone therapy on pregnancy risk.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare health and health risk factors between LGB adults and heterosexual adults in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data from the nationally representative 2013 and 2014 National Health Interview Survey were used to compare health outcomes among lesbian (n = 525), gay (n = 624), and bisexual (n = 515) adults who were 18 years or older and their heterosexual peers (n = 67 150) using logistic regression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-rated health, functional status, chronic conditions, psychological distress, alcohol consumption, and cigarette use. RESULTS The study cohort comprised 68 814 participants. Their mean (SD) age was 46.8 (11.8) years, and 51.8\% (38 063 of 68 814) were female. After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, gay men were more likely to report severe psychological distress (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95\% CI, 1.55-5.14), heavy drinking (OR, 1.97; 95\% CI, 1.08-3.58), and moderate smoking (OR, 1.98; 95\% CI, 1.39-2.81) than heterosexual men; bisexual men were more likely to report severe psychological distress (OR, 4.70; 95\% CI, 1.77-12.52), heavy drinking (OR, 3.15; 95\% CI, 1.22-8.16), and heavy smoking (OR, 2.10; 95\% CI, 1.08-4.10) than heterosexual men; lesbian women were more likely to report moderate psychological distress (OR, 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.76), poor or fair health (OR, 1.91; 95\% CI, 1.24-2.95), multiple chronic conditions (OR, 1.58; 95\% CI, 1.12-2.22), heavy drinking (OR, 2.63; 95\% CI, 1.54-4.50), and heavy smoking (OR, 2.29; 95\% CI, 1.36-3.88) than heterosexual women; and bisexual women were more likely to report multiple chronic conditions (OR, 2.07; 95\% CI, 1.34-3.20), severe psychological distress (OR, 3.69; 95\% CI, 2.19-6.22), heavy drinking (OR, 2.07; 95\% CI, 1.20-3.59), and moderate smoking (OR, 1.60; 95\% CI, 1.05-2.44) than heterosexual women. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study supports prior research finding substantial health disparities for LGB adults in the United States, potentially due to the stressors that LGB people experience as a result of interpersonal and structural discrimination. In screening for health issues, clinicians should be sensitive to the needs of sexual minority patients.},

METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was administered to 164 Hispanic men using standardized measures for Hispanic Stress (Cervantes, Padilla, \& Salgado de Snyder, 1991), substance abuse (Kelly et al., 1994), violence (Peragallo et al., 2005), risk for HIV (Gonz\'alez-Guarda, Peragallo, Urrutia, Vasquez, \& Mitrani, 2008), and depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Scale, CES-D; Radloff, 1977). RESULTS: Results from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) supported the syndemic factor among Hispanic men. While family/cultural stress and homosexual identity were risk factors for the syndemic factor, family support was protective. CONCLUSIONS: More longitudinal research is needed to identify influences on the syndemic factor among diverse Hispanic communities. Interventions that address stress and enhance family supports may show promise in addressing and preventing syndemics among Hispanic men. (PsycINFO Database Record},

  abstract = {Older people can struggle with revealing their depression to GPs and verbalising preferences regarding its management. This contributes to problems for GPs in both detecting and managing depression in primary care. The aim of this study was to explore older people's accounts of how they talk about depression and possible symptoms to improve communication about depression when seeing GPs. Adopting a qualitative Interpretivist methodological approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted by IG based on the principles of grounded theory and situational analysis. GPs working in north east England recruited patients aged over 65 with depression. Data analysis was carried out with a process of constant comparison, and categories were developed via open and axial coding and situational maps. There were three levels of analysis; the first developed open codes which informed the second level of analysis where the typology was developed from axial codes. The typology derived from second level analysis only is presented here as older people's views are rarely reported in isolation. From the sixteen interviews with older people, it was evident that there were differences in how they understood and accepted their depression and that this influenced what they shared or withheld in their narratives. A typology showing three categories of older people was identified: those who appeared to talk about their depression freely yet struggled to accept aspects of it (Superficial Accepter), those who consolidated their ideas about depression aloud (Striving to Understand) and those who shared minimal detail about their depression and viewed it as part of them rather than a treatable condition (Unable to Articulate). The central finding was that older people's acceptance and understanding of their depression guided their depression narratives. This study identified differences between older people in ways they understand, accept and share their depression. Recognising that their depression narratives can change and listening for patterns in what older people share or withhold may help GPs in facilitating communication to better understand the patient when they need to implement alternative approaches to patient management.},

This study aimed to explore the social and environmental context in which new HIV infections occurred among MSM in London and Brighton in 2015. Design: A qualitative descriptive study, comprising in-depth interviews, was carried out as a substudy to the UK Register of HIV Seroconverters cohort: an observational cohort of individuals whose date of HIV seroconversion was well estimated. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted in NVivo, guided by a socio-ecological framework. Setting: Participants were recruited from six HIV clinics in London and Brighton. Fieldwork was conducted between January and April 2015. Participants: All MSM eligible for the UK Register Seroconverter cohort (an HIV-positive antibody test result within 12 months of their last documented HIV-negative test or other laboratory evidence of HIV seroconversion) diagnosed within the past 12 months and aged {$\geq$}18 were eligible for the qualitative substudy. 21 MSM participated, aged 22-61 years and predominantly white. Results: A complex interplay of factors, operating at different levels, influenced risk behaviours and HIV acquisition. Participants: saw risk as multi-factorial, but the relative importance of factors varied for each person. Individual psycho-social factors, including personal history, recent life stressors and mental health, enhanced vulnerability towards higher risk situations, while features of the social environment, such as chemsex and social media, and prevalent community beliefs regarding treatment and HIV normalisation, encouraged risk taking. Conclusions: Recently acquired HIV infection among MSM reflects a complex web of factors operating at different levels. These findings point to the need for multi-level interventions to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition among high-risk MSM in the UK and similar settings.},

  abstract = {Background In Germany, drug use in sexual settings (i.e. chemsex) among men who have sex with men (MSM) has increasingly been the subject of discussion for considerable time. At the same time, however, little is known about this practice. It is against this background that what is currently known about chemsex among MSM in Germany is discussed. Methods: The present study observations are essentially based on the results of two research projects of a qualitative-explorative nature. In-depth interviews with drug-using MSM (n = 14), as well as qualitative, problem-centred interviews with drug-using MSM (n = 75) and expert interviews (n = 27) were conducted within these research projects. Results: Chemsex is a minority behaviour among MSM in Germany. The reasons for using drugs in sexual settings are manifold. For the most part, the effects of the drugs are used to intensify sexual feelings and to achieve greater intimacy. Men who consider their consumption to be problematic, in particular, report a range of negative consequences, such as sexually transmissible infections. Even though chemsex is a minority behaviour, suitable offers of support are, hence, necessary, especially for these men. However, such offers are not yet available in most German cities. Conclusions: In order to close this gap in provision of support services, tangible practical steps, such as further training of people who work at drug and gay advisory services, are necessary, along with further research into the backgrounds and contexts of chemsex.},

The purpose of this study was to develop a deeper understanding of the parent perspective of the disclosure to family experience of SMY ages 14 to 21. In-depth interviews were conducted with eight parents in the United States who had experienced a child disclose their gay, lesbian, or bisexual (GLB) orientation to them. Constructivist grounded theory and symbolic interaction theory informed the methodology and data analysis for the project. Analysis revealed that the process of becoming the parent of a GLB son or daughter is an appropriate narrative to conceptualize the parental experience of the disclosure-to-family process. The findings highlight how disclosure introduces new roles into the existing family system, which affects the consideration and interpretation of the salience of particular identities, such as being the parent of a GLB son or daughter. Understanding how parents experience the disclosure-to-family process -- particularly, how they understand and re-envision the meaning of being a parent -- is crucial for research and intervention to help families become supportive of SMY. Limitations and suggestions for future research are presented. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {In the context of decreasing or plateauing HIV incidence among multiple risk groups in United States, new HIV infections among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to rise. Syndemic theory has become a well-established framework for the explanation of how individual experiences and social conditions influence both an individual's disease experience and the distribution of disease across populations. This framework is currently defined as "a set of enmeshed and mutually enhancing health problems that, working together in a context of deleterious social and physical conditions that increase vulnerability, [and] significantly affect the overall disease status of a population."1 An important and robust body of literature has been amassed investigating syndemic burden and its association with HIV status, HIV incidence, HIV-related sexual risk behaviors, and more recently, antiretroviral (ART) medication adherence and viral suppression among HIV-positive MSM. Many of the studies that comprise this literature have several things in common. They are mostly focused on enmeshed individual-level risk factors; that is, this literature largely focuses on co-occurrence of these health problems and the increased vulnerability to HIV that may develop as a result. Even more importantly, most of these studies focused on a small subset of these risk factors: childhood sexual abuse, depression, intimate partner violence, polydrug use. These studies also largely ignore the synergy (defined as biological interaction on the additive scale or deviations from additivity) implied in the mutually enhancing language of this framework. Finally, this literature is also unable to account for the "deleterious social and physical conditions" that give context to the individual-level burden. Taken together, the body of studies present an important but not fully realized use of this framework. This dissertation seeks to investigate all three major facets of the syndemic framework: the individual-level co-occurring syndemic factors, the implied synergy, and the social and physical conditions that surround and influence the individual. It will do so in three steps, broadly defined by a systematic literature review followed by two analytic papers. The literature review will serve as a guide to the syndemics literature among MSM, and will identify the constellation of experiences that have been identified as syndemic factors. The identified experiences will be used to guide the first analytic paper, which will incorporate those experiences into syndemic burden, which will then be modeled using latent class modeling (LCA) to investigate if there are any patterns of syndemic burden that may be important to intervention development. This first analytic paper will also explicitly investigate synergy by calculating the attributable proportion due to interaction (AP). Finally, the second analytic paper will incorporate the "deleterious social and physical conditions" using multilevel latent class modeling (MLCA).

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to provide a preliminary characterization of new-onset abdominopelvic pain reported by trans-masculine persons after initiation of testosterone gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). Methods: From December 2015 to February 2017, an anonymous survey was distributed through social media, listservs, and community centers to trans-masculine persons, 18 years or older, on testosterone GAHT, who experienced new-onset abdominopelvic pain after initiating GAHT. Results: Of the 183 persons who completed the survey, 127 (69.4\%) endorsed new-onset abdominopelvic pain since the initiation of testosterone GAHT. Median interval from testosterone initiation to pain onset was 1 year (range: 1 month to 20 years). The majority of respondents reported pain that was intermittent (79.5\%), cramping in nature (75.6\%), and localized to the suprapubic region (78.7\%). Those with a uterus and ovaries were 9.50 times (95\% confidence interval 2.85\textendash 31.66) more likely to endorse suprapubic localization (as opposed to other abdominopelvic regions). All 28 respondents who reported pain resolution with treatment, identified this treatment as a hysterectomy. Conclusion: In this preliminary evaluation of new-onset abdominopelvic pain experienced by trans-masculine persons after the initiation of testosterone GAHT, the combination of suprapubic localization of pain with self-reported effectiveness of hysterectomy as treatment suggests a reproductive cause. Based on our data, clinicians should be aware of the possibility that trans-masculine persons may present for this concern. This study offers a starting point for research. Further prospective studies are necessary to evaluate the incidence, cause(s), and the most appropriate interventions.},

We examined trends in SID milestones by birth cohort in a 2015 U.S. national sample of GBM (n = 1,023). Birth cohort was independent of when men first felt sexually attracted to someone of the same sex (median age 11 to 12). However, with the exception of age of first same-sex attraction, older cohorts tended to pass other milestones at later ages than younger cohorts. Latent class analysis (LCA) of SID mile-stone patterns identified three subgroups. The majority (84\%) began sexual identity development with same-sex attraction around the onset of puberty (i.e., around age 10) and progressed to self-identification, same-sex sexual activity, and coming out\textemdash in that order. The other two classes felt same-sex attraction during teen years (ages 12.5 to 18.0) but achieved the remaining SID milestones later in life. For 13\% of men, this was during early adulthood; for 3\% of men, this was in middle adulthood. Findings highlight the need to monitor ongoing generational differ-ences in passing SID milestones.

To do this, we evaluated psychosocial health conditions and their associations with unprotected sex, HIV prevalence and HIV incidence in a cohort of Thai MSM (N = 1,292). There was a positive and significant association between the number of psychosocial health conditions and increased levels of unprotected sex and HIV prevalence at study baseline. The number of psychosocial health conditions at baseline was also associated with increased HIV incidence during follow-up (no conditions, HIV incidence = 15.3 \%; one to three conditions, 23.7 \%; four to five conditions, 33.2 \%). The number of psychosocial health conditions was positively associated with HIV risk behavior and HIV prevalence and incidence. Prevention efforts among MSM need to address the existence of multiple psychosocial health conditions and their synergy to effectively decrease the spread of HIV infection.},

A predictive MuLBSTA score was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model in order to predict mortality with a weighted score that included multilobular infiltrates (OR = 5.20, 95\% CI 1.41\textendash 12.52, p = 0.010; 5 points), lymphocyte {$\leq$} 0.8{${_\ast}$}109/L (OR = 4.53, 95\% CI 2.55\textendash 8.05, p {$<$} 0.001; 4 points), bacterial coinfection (OR = 3.71, 95\% CI 2.11\textendash 6.51, p {$<$} 0.001; 4 points), acute-smoker (OR = 3.19, 95\% CI 1.34\textendash 6.26, p = 0.001; 3 points), quit-smoker (OR = 2.18, 95\% CI 0.99\textendash 4.82, p = 0.054; 2 points), hypertension (OR = 2.39, 95\% CI 1.55\textendash 4.26, p = 0.003; 2 points) and age {$\geq$}60 years (OR = 2.14, 95\% CI 1.04\textendash 4.39, p = 0.038; 2 points). 12 points was used as a cut-off value for mortality risk stratification. This model showed sensitivity of 0.776, specificity of 0.778 and a better predictive ability than CURB-65 (AUROC = 0.773 vs. 0.717, p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion Here, we designed an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool for assessing 90-day mortality risk of viral pneumonia. It can accurately stratify hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia into relevant risk categories and could provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.},

  abstract = {Network Analysis is considered as a new method that challenges Latent Variable models in inferring psychological attributes. With Network Analysis, psychological attributes are derived from a complex system of components without the need to call on any latent variables. But the ontological status of psychological attributes is not adequately defined with Network Analysis, because a psychological attribute is both a complex system and a property emerging from this complex system. The aim of this article is to reappraise the legitimacy of latent variable models by engaging in an ontological and epistemological discussion on psychological attributes. Psychological attributes relate to the mental equilibrium of individuals embedded in their social interactions, as robust attractors within complex dynamic processes with emergent properties, distinct from physical entities located in precise areas of the brain. Latent variables thus possess legitimacy, because the emergent properties can be conceptualized and analyzed on the sole basis of their manifestations, without exploring the upstream complex system. However, in opposition with the usual Latent Variable models, this article is in favor of the integration of a dynamic system of manifestations. Latent Variables models and Network Analysis thus appear as complementary approaches. New approaches combining Latent Network Models and Network Residuals are certainly a promising new way to infer psychological attributes, placing psychological attributes in an inter-subjective dynamic approach. Pragmatism-realism appears as the epistemological framework required if we are to use latent variables as representations of psychological attributes.},

This article uses a conjunctural perspective to make sense of the rise of chemsex within the historical conditions in which it has emerged. Drawing on a document analysis as well as interviews with 15 gay and bisexual men, this article argues that the rise of chemsex can be interpreted as an embodied response to material conditions shaped by neoliberalism: specifically as a desire for an intimate mode of collectivity during a historical moment when collectivity itself is being superseded by competitive individualism as the privileged mode of being in the world (Gilbert, J.

Comprehensive sex education programs have the potential to result in delayed sexual debut, increased condom and contraceptive use, and reduced sexual risk-taking; however, little research has explored the specific sex education needs of TNB youth. Aim: To use insights from TNB youth, parents of TNB youth, and healthcare affiliates to understand deficits in sex education experienced by TNB youth, and to elicit recommended content for a comprehensive and transinclusive sex education curriculum. Methods: We conducted 21 in-depth interviews with non-minor TNB youth (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 11) and with parents (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 5) and healthcare affiliates (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 5) of TNB youth recruited from Seattle Children's Gender Clinic and local TNB community listerv readerships. Data was analyzed using theoretical thematic analysis. Outcomes: Participants described prior sex education experiences and content needs of TNB youth. Results: Participants described 5 key sources where TNB youth received sexual health information: school curricula, medical practitioners, peers, romantic partners, and online media. Inapplicability of school curricula and variable interactions with medical practitioners led youth to favor the latter sources. 8 content areas were recommended as important in sex education for TNB youth: puberty-related gender dysphoria, non-medical gender-affirming interventions, medical gender-affirming interventions, consent and relationships, sex and desire, sexually transmitted infection prevention, fertility and contraception, and healthcare access. Clinical Implications: Dependence on potentially inaccurate sex education sources leaves TNB youth vulnerable to negative outcomes, including sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, unsanitary/unsafe sex toy use, and shame about their body or sexual desires. Strengths \& Limitations: Strengths included capturing perspectives of an underserved population using openended interview questions, which allowed topics of greatest importance to participants to arise organically. Limitations included a sample size of 21 participants, and racial and geographic homogeneity of youth and parent participants. Only 1 author identifies as TNB. One-on-one interview methods may have omitted participants who would otherwise have been willing to share their perspective in a more impersonal format. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that TNB youth have unique sex education needs that are not well covered in most sexual health curricula. Recommended content for this population includes standard sex education topics that require trans-inclusive framing (eg, contraception), topics specific to TNB youth (eg, gender-affirming medical interventions), and topics absent from standard curricula that warrant universal teaching (eg, information on consent as it relates to sex acts aside from penile-vaginal sex).

To understand these relationships, data drawn from a study of gay, bisexual, and other YMSM were used to examine associations between perceived parental psychopathology and the health of YMSM. Findings suggest that YMSM reporting at least one parent with perceived depression, manic depression, schizophrenia, or antisocial behavior anytime during their childhoods were more likely to report higher levels of both depressive symptomatology and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than those reporting no perception of any of these psychopathologies in their parents. Number of different drugs used in one's life were higher among participants who perceived at least one parent as depressed. Mediation analyses indicated that the relationship between perceived parental depression and lifetime drug use of YMSM was mediated both by YMSM depression and YMSM PTSD. These results suggest that parental psychopathology plays an important role in the health of sexual minority men, a population with elevated levels of mental health burden and drug use across the lifespan.},

Our investigation is the first to consider the applicability of the theory in a sample of aging (ages 50 and over) HIV-positive MSM, which is a growing population in the United States. A sample of 199 men were actively recruited and assessed in terms of mental health and drug use burden, as well as sexual risk behaviors. Bivariate and multivariable analyses indicate a high level of association between psychosocial burdens (i.e., drug use and mental health) and same-sex unprotected sexual behaviors, providing initial support for the applicability of the theory of syndemics to this population. Further support can be seen in participants' narratives. Findings suggest the mutually reinforcing nature of drug use, psychiatric disorders, and unprotected sexual behavior in older, HIV-positive, gay, bisexual, and other MSM, highlighting the need for holistic strategies to prevention and care among this population of older and sexually active individuals. In short, the generation of gay men who came of age in the late 1970s and 1980s, "the AIDS Generation," are continuing to mature such that further efforts must be enacted to meet the multidimensional nature of these men's physical, mental, and sexual health needs.},

These interrelated health problems and social issues can be characterized as a syndemic of mutually reinforcing conditions or epidemics. Moreover, the syndemic is directed by biological, behavioral, psychosocial, and structural determinants.

Participants were actively recruited from community-based settings and the Internet for participation in a seven-wave cohort study. Data for participant characteristics and mental health were collected via computer-assisted survey, while drug use and unprotected sex behaviors for the month prior to assessment were collected via a calendar-based technique. Using the baseline data, we developed and tested structural equation models for mental health burden, drug use, and unprotected sex and also tested a second-order model for a single syndemic. First-order measurement models for each of the three epidemics were successfully identified using observed data. Tests of a second-order model seeking to explain the three epidemics as a single syndemic fit poorly. However, a second-order construct comprised of mental health burden and drug use fit the data well and was highly associated with the first-order construct of unprotected sex. The findings advance a theory of syndemics and suggest that in order to be maximally effective both HIV prevention and HIV care must be delivered holistically such that sexual risk behaviors are addressed in relation to, and in sync with, the drug use and mental health of the individual.},

In order to better understand the continued existence of these disparities in STI/HIV risk among YMSM, the present study evaluated the presence and persistence of syndemic conditions among YMSM by examining the co-occurrence of alcohol and drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden over time. Four waves of data, collected over the first 18 months of a 7 wave, 36-month prospective cohort study of YMSM (n=600) were used to examine the extent to which measurement models of drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden remained consistent across time using latent class modeling. Health challenges persisted across time as these YMSM emerged into young adulthood and the measurement models for the latent constructs of drug use and unprotected sexual behavior were essentially consistent across time whereas models for mental health burden varied over time. In addition to confirming the the robustness of our measurement models which capture a more holistic understandings of the health conditions of drug use, unprotected sex, and mental health burden, these findings underscore the ongoing health challenges YMSM face as they mature into young adulthood. These ongoing health challenges, which have been understood as forming a syndemic, persist over time, and add further evidence to support ongoing and vigilant comprehensive health programming for sexual minority men that move beyond a sole focus on HIV.},

  abstract = {We sought to characterize HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and psychosocial correlates of adherence in a sample of gay, bisexual, and other non-gay or -bisexual identified men who have sex with men aged 50 and over. As part of a cross-sectional study we recruited a community-based sample of 199 men and assessed adherence to current ART medications along four domains: (1) missing doses in the past 4 days, (2) taking doses on the specified schedule in the past 4 days, (3) following instructions about how to take the medications (e.g., to take medications with food), and (4) missing doses in the last weekend. A total adherence score was also computed. Bivariable analyses indicated negative associations between depression, sexual compulsivity, and HIV-related stigma with each of the individual adherence variables and the composite adherence score, while an older age was found to be protective. In multivariable analyses, controlling for age and educational attainment, a higher likelihood of missing doses and failing to follow instructions were related to higher levels of HIV-related stigma, while dosing off-schedule and missing doses on weekends was associated with higher levels of sexual compulsivity. These results indicate that psychosocial burdens undermine the adherence behaviors of older HIV-positive sexual minority men. Programming and services to address this compromising health behavior must embrace a holistic approach to health as informed by syndemics theory, while attending to the developmental and age-specific needs of older men.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sexual minority men (SMM) in the United States continue to experience adverse health problems and psychosocial burdens. However, there is limited psychometric research seeking to quantify the life worries of this population. Informed by syndemic theory, the Life Worries Scale (LWS) was developed to measure the concerns of young SMM., METHOD: Analyses of the scale were undertaken using baseline data (n = 665) from an ongoing cohort study of emerging adult, SMM., RESULTS: Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) of an initial set of 24 Likert-type items, followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and an exploratory structural equation model (ESEM), indicated a structure consisting of 6 domains of worries: financial stability, social stability, self esteem, loneliness, physical appearance, and physical health. These 6 subscales were highly correlated and also demonstrated high levels of internal consistency. Differences in life worries were noted across demographic states, specifically HIV serostatus, sexual attraction, housing status, and self-rated health. High levels of association were also detected between all 6 subscales with both depression and PTSD, while significant correlations were detected between suicidality and both self esteem and loneliness related worries., CONCLUSIONS: The results of our analyses provide evidence for the strong psychometric characteristics of the LWS. This newly developed instrument should be utilized in research to examine the extent to which life worries explain health outcomes and risk behaviors in sexual minority males, and may be potentially extended for use in other populations.

Correlation analysis and ANCOVAs controlling for age and nationality demonstrated that the 6 sequential stages of HIF were associated with a U-shaped function for the psychosocial variables. Well-being was high during the initial Confusion and Comparison stages of HIF, was reduced during the middle Tolerance and Acceptance stages, and was again high in the later Pride and Synthesis stages. Each of the psychosocial variables was significantly different according to stage of development (p {$<$}.001).

  abstract = {Introduction: Gay and bisexual men (GBM) often use illicit drugs to enhance sexual pleasure, commonly referred to as `chemsex' or `party n play'. In particular, the use of methamphetamine and Viagra\texttrademark{} and other erectile dysfunction medications, both together and separately are strongly predictive of subsequent HIV infection. Truvada\texttrademark{} as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), virtually eliminates HIV transmission during condomless anal intercourse (CLAI). HIV-negative GBM in intensive sex partying networks may be adding PrEP to their drug regimen to actively reduce the possibility of HIV transmission during chemsex. Aim: We describe the prevalence and context of concurrent use of methamphetamine, Truvada\texttrademark{} (or its generic formulations), and Viagra\texttrademark{} or other erectile dysfunction medication (collectively, MTV). Method: The Following Lives Undergoing Change study is an online prospective observational study of licit and illicit drug use among Australian GBM. Between January and July 2017, 1831 GBM provided details about their use of MTV. Binary logistic multiple regression analysis were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and associated 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI). Results: Concurrent MTV use was reported by 6.0\% of participants; 3.1\% used methamphetamine and Viagra\texttrademark{} or other erectile dysfunction medication (`MV only') and 11.2\% used Truvada\texttrademark{} as PrEP (`T only'). In multivariate analysis, compared to use of `MV only' MTV was independently associated with CLAI with casual partners (aOR = 6.78;95\%CI = 1.42\textendash 32.34) and `fuckbuddies' (aOR = 3.47;95\%CI = 1.41\textendash 8.56) in the previous six months. Compared to use of `T only' MTV was independently associated with being older (aOR = 3.95;95\%CI = 1.55\textendash 10.03) and engaging in group sex (aOR = 3.31;95\%CI = 1.82\textendash 6.00). Greater social engagement with other gay men (aOR = 1.44;95\%CI = 1.18\textendash 1.76) and having more sexual partners (aOR = 2.30;95\%CI = 1.10\textendash 4.82) were independently associated with use of MTV compared to use of `MV only' or `T only'. Conclusion: GBM in intensive sex partying networks are increasingly adding PrEP alongside other drugs they use to enhance sexual experiences. Interventions that promote the use of PrEP during chemsex could mitigate HIV risk.},

  abstract = {Background Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) use among gay and bisexual men (GBM) has increased in recent years. It is commonly cited as a sexual-enhancement drug. There is, however, little evidence for factors associated with GHB use or the consequences of its use among GBM. Aim: Factors associated with GHB use, its relationship to sexual risk behaviour, and the contexts, consequences, and motivations for its use were examined. Methods: The Following Lives Undergoing Change (Flux) Study is an online prospective observational study of Australian GBM. At baseline, a total of 3190 GBM provided details about their use of GHB. Data on frequency, methods, pleasures and consequences of their drug use, alongside key demographic variables were collected. Results: Mean age was 35.0 years. One in five men (19.5\%) had a history of GHB use and 5.4\% reported use within the past 6 months, with 2.7\% having used it monthly or more frequently. Overdose had been experienced by 14.7\%, this was more common among men who used GHB at least monthly. Being HIV-positive, having more gay friends, greater social engagement with gay men who use drugs, a greater number of sexual partners, group sex, and condomless anal intercourse with casual partners were independently associated with GHB use in the past 6 months. Greater social engagement with gay men who use drugs and group sex were independently associated with at least monthly use. More frequent GHB use was independently associated with experiencing overdose among GHB users. Conclusion: Most men used GHB infrequently and it was often used explicitly to enhance sexual experiences, often in the context of intensive sex partying. Men who used GHB frequently, were at greater risk of overdose and other negative health outcomes. GHB use should be considered alongside other drugs that have been implicated in sexual risk behaviour and HIV transmission. Harm-reduction interventions need to consider the particular impact of frequent GHB use.},

  address = {{US}},
  abstract = {After more than 30 years since the beginning of the HIV epidemic in the U.S., gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to suffer from disproportionate rates of HIV. In addition, it is predicted that in the near future over 50\% of individuals infected with HIV in the U.S. will be over the age of 50, with gay, bisexual, and other MSM making up the majority of this population. Given this, more research is need in order to better understand the experiences of HIV-positive gay, bisexual, and other MSM over 50 as they transition into later adulthood. This dissertation attempted to address this gap in scholarship via the use of syndemic theory. Specifically, structural equation modeling techniques were used in order to assess for a possible syndemic among HIV-positive gay, bisexual, and other MSM over 50 in New York City. This syndemic was theorized to be comprised of the epidemics of mental health burden, substance use, and sexual risk-taking. Three first-order latent factors were found for mental health burden, substance use, and sexual risk-taking respectively. An attempt to construct a second-order latent factor, which was constitutive of the three first-order latent factors, and theorized to represent an overall syndemic among the men sampled, was unsuccessful. Further analyses attempted to assess the impact of lifetime reports of mental health burden, substance use, and sexual risk-taking on the presence of the three first-order latent factors at the time of assessment. In addition, the relations between the potential protective factors of religiosity, spirituality, and existential well-being and the three first-order latent factors of mental health burden, substance use, and sexual risk-taking at the time of assessment were assessed. Models assessing for the impact of lifetime reports of burden and risk, as well as for the noted protective factors, provided poor model fit. Further moderation effects were hypothesized; however, these hypotheses remained untested, due to poor model fit. The theoretical, public health, and counseling implications of these findings is discussed. In addition, given the results of this study, the need for further prospective study in order to assess for the potential of a syndemic among HIV-positive gay, bisexual, and other MSM in the U.S. is highlighted.

Over the course of the 1-year data collection period (up to 5 observations per participant), participants completed self-report measures of CAS, as well as six syndemic factors: post-traumatic stress disorder, childhood sexual abuse, depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and polysubstance/stimulant use. We employed multilevel modeling to examine the longitudinal additive effect of syndemics on serodiscordant CAS (binary) over the 1-year period. The number of syndemic conditions was a significant predictor of CAS, with each additional syndemic associated with 1.41 greater odds of CAS (p =.0004; 95\% CI [1.16, 1.70]). Both the between-person (p =.0121, 95\% CI [1.07, 1.69]) and within-person (p =.01, 95\% CI [1.11, 2.10]) effects of syndemics were significant predictors, showing that an increase in the number of syndemic conditions across person and time both increased odds of CAS. Interventions addressing HIV-positive sexual minority men's sexual health behaviors should address the potential impact of co-occurring psychosocial concerns that affect these behaviors. This will benefit this population's personal sexual health and reduce transmission of HIV and STIs among sexual minority men.},

In a study of 470 ethnically diverse HIV-negative GBM, regression models were computed using number of syndemic psychosocial problems, number of psychosocial strengths, and serodiscordant condomless anal sex (CAS). The number of syndemic psychosocial problems correlated with serodiscordant CAS (RR~=~1.51, 95\% CI 1.18-1.92; p~=~0.001). When adding the number of psychosocial strengths to the model, the effect of syndemic psychosocial problems became non-significant, but the number of strengths-based factors remained significant (RR~=~0.67, 95\% CI 0.53-0.86; p~=~0.002). Psychosocial strengths may operate additively in the same way as syndemic psychosocial problems, but in the opposite direction. Consistent with theories of resilience, psychosocial strengths may be an important set of variables predicting sexual risk behavior that is largely missing from the current HIV behavioral literature.},

  abstract = {Background. Network analyses on psychopathological data focus on the network structure and its derivatives such as node centrality. One conclusion one can draw from centrality measures is that the node with the highest centrality is likely to be the node that is determined most by its neighboring nodes. However, centrality is a relative measure: knowing that a node is highly central gives no information about the extent to which it is determined by its neighbors. Here we provide an absolute measure of determination (or controllability) of a node \textendash{} its predictability. We introduce predictability, estimate the predictability of all nodes in 18 prior empirical network papers on psychopathology, and statistically relate it to centrality. Methods. We carried out a literature review and collected 25 datasets from 18 published papers in the field (several mood and anxiety disorders, substance abuse, psychosis, autism, and transdiagnostic data). We fit state-of-the-art network models to all datasets, and computed the predictability of all nodes. Results. Predictability was unrelated to sample size, moderately high in most symptom networks, and differed considerable both within and between datasets. Predictability was higher in community than clinical samples, highest for mood and anxiety disorders, and lowest for psychosis. Conclusions. Predictability is an important additional characterization of symptom networks because it gives an absolute measure of the controllability of each node. It allows conclusions about how self-determined a symptom network is, and may help to inform intervention strategies. Limitations of predictability along with future directions are discussed.},

While studying the structure of network models has led to many important insights, little attention has been paid to how well they predict observations. This is despite the fact that predictability is crucial for judging the practical relevance of edges: for instance in clinical practice, predictability of a symptom indicates whether an intervention on that symptom through the symptom network is promising. We close this methodological gap by introducing nodewise predictability, which quantifies how well a given node can be predicted by all other nodes it is connected to in the network. In addition, we provide fully reproducible code examples of how to compute and visualize nodewise predictability both for cross-sectional and time series data.},

In addition, we allow to relax the stationarity assumption of both models by introducing time-varying versions MGMs and mVAR models based on a kernel weighting approach. Time-varying models offer a rich description of temporally evolving systems and allow to identify external influences on the model structure such as the impact of interventions.

  abstract = {Introduction Introduction to the special issue on structural stigma and health Introduction Stimulated by the pioneering work of Goffman (1963), research into the causes and consequences of stigma has proliferated over the past five decades. Progress has been made in the construction of new concepts, measures, and methodological approaches that have illuminated how stigma works to the disadvantage of those targeted by it. The culmination of this intense scrutiny has created the capacity to more deeply understand this powerful human phe-nomenon, opening the possibility to address its unwanted effects. At the same time, in the midst of this growth and advancement, the stigma concept has been criticized on several fronts. One of the most consistent criticisms has been that stigma research is too individually focused (Link \& Phelan, 2001; Parker \& Aggleton, 2003). According to Oliver (1992), the central thrust of stigma research has been focused on the perceptions of individuals and the consequences of such perceptions for micro-level interactions, rather than on structural issues underlying stigma. In part to address this criticism, researchers have recently expanded the stigma construct to consider how broader, macro-social forms of stigmadtermed structural stigmadmay also disad-vantage the stigmatized. For instance, Link and Phelan's (2001) influential conceptualization of stigma distinguished between discrimination at individual and structural levels and noted that the concept of structural stigma " sensitizes us to the fact that all manner of disadvantage can result outside of a model in which one person does something bad to another " (p. 382). Despite initial attempts to define (Link \& Phelan, 2001) and measure (Corrigan et al., 2005) structural stigma, there has been limited empirical investigation of the extent to which structural stigma represents a risk indicator for adverse health outcomes among stigmatized in-dividuals. This dearth of empirical research on structural stigma has led researchers to conclude that this under-representation repre-sents " a dramatic shortcoming in the literature on stigma, as the processes involved are likely major contributors to unequal out-comes " (Link, Yang, Phelan, \& Collins, 2004, pp. 515e16). Recent research, however, has begun to generate a tantalizing set of findings concerning the role of structural stigma in the pro-duction of negative outcomes for members of stigmatized groups, including individuals with mental illness (Evans-Lacko, Brohan, Mojtabai, \& Thornicroft, 2012), sexual minorities (Hatzenbuehler, 2011), Blacks (Krieger, 2012), and individuals infected with HIV/ AIDS (Miller, Grover, Bunn, \& Solomon, 2011). In one example of this work, Hatzenbuehler, Keyes, and Hasin (2009) coded states for levels of structural stigma surrounding lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals, operationalized as the absence of policies that confer protection to gays and lesbiansdnamely, hate crime statutes and employment nondiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation as a protected class. The researchers linked this policy information to individual-level data on mental health and sexual orientation from a large nationally representative survey of U.S. adults. Sexual orientation disparities in mental health were lower in low-structural stigma states. For instance, sexual orientation disparities in dysthymia (a mood disorder) were elimi-nated in states with protective policies; however, LGB adults who lived in states with no protective policies were nearly 2.5 times as likely to have dysthymia as were heterosexuals in those same states. Results remained robust after controlling for demographic covariates and perceived discrimination, suggesting that structural stigma contributes to psychiatric disorders independent of individ-ual stigma. These initial findings have shown the impact of struc-tural stigma to be substantial and thereby indicated the need to understand it more thoroughly. To capitalize on the exciting advancements of this emerging line of research on structural stigma, we founded the Structural Stigma and Population Health Working Group at Columbia University, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health \& Society Scholars program. We brought together an interdisciplinary group of psychologists, sociologists, social epidemiologists, and anthro-pologists to meet twice a month to advance and develop new ap-proaches to theory, methods, and empirical evidence bearing on the role of stigma as a social determinant of population health. Af-ter meeting for over a year, our group came to the conclusion that bringing the " social " squarely back into the stigma conceptdand examining the impact of these structural forms of stigma on health-drequired attention to several overlapping foci, including: (1) conceptualizing novel definitions of social/structural dimensions of stigma; (2) measuring and statistically modeling stigma as a structural determinant of health; (3) identifying relationships be-tween structural and individual stigma in predicting health out-comes; and (4) designing interventions to reduce structural forms of stigma that create and perpetuate health inequalities. After pur-suing these topics on our own, we invited several experts in the field of stigma, discrimination and health to a conference to discuss these topics further. This special issue " Structural Stigma and Health " emerged out of this larger discussion. Conceptualizing structural stigma As we note above, stigma researchers have emphasized the need to conceptualize and measure stigma as a social phenomenon with roots in social structures. This, of course, requires the articulation of},

METHODS We conducted a systematic review (SR) of systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and prospective long-term observational studies of the use of cannabinoids in pain management and palliative medicine. Pertinent publications from January 2009 to January 2017 were retrieved by a selective search in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Medline. The methodological quality of the SRs was assessed with the AMSTAR instrument, and the clinical relevance of quantitative data syntheses was assessed according to the standards of the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS Of the 750 publications identified, 11 SRs met the inclusion criteria; 3 of them were of high and 8 of moderate methodological quality. 2 prospective long-term observational studies with medical cannabis and 1 with tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol spray (THC/CBD spray) were also analyzed. There is limited evidence for a benefit of THC/CBD spray in the treatment of neuropathic pain. There is inadequate evidence for any benefit of cannabinoids (dronabinol, nabilone, medical cannabis, or THC/CBD spray) to treat cancer pain, pain of rheumatic or gastrointestinal origin, or anorexia in cancer or AIDS. Treatment with cannabis-based medicines is associated with central nervous and psychiatric side effects. CONCLUSION The public perception of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of cannabis-based medicines in pain management and palliative medicine conflicts with the findings of systematic reviews and prospective observational studies conducted according to the standards of evidence-based medicine.},

  abstract = {Cannabis-based medicines are being approved for pain management in an increasing number of European countries. There are uncertainties and controversies on the role and appropriate use of cannabis-based medicines for the management of chronic pain. EFIC convened a European group of experts, drawn from a diverse range of basic science and relevant clinical disciplines, to prepare a position paper to empower and inform specialist and nonspecialist prescribers on appropriate use of cannabis-based medicines for chronic pain. The expert panel reviewed the available literature and harnessed the clinical experience to produce these series of recommendations. Therapy with cannabis-based medicines should only be considered by experienced clinicians as part of a multidisciplinary treatment and preferably as adjunctive medication if guideline-recommended first- and second-line therapies have not provided sufficient efficacy or tolerability. The quantity and quality of evidence are such that cannabis-based medicines may be reasonably considered for chronic neuropathic pain. For all other chronic pain conditions (cancer, non-neuropathic noncancer pain), the use of cannabis-based medicines should be regarded as an individual therapeutic trial. Realistic goals of therapy have to be defined. All patients must be kept under close clinical surveillance. As with any other medical therapy, if the treatment fails to reach the predefined goals and/or the patient is additionally burdened by an unacceptable level of adverse effects and/or there are signs of abuse and misuse of the drug by the patient, therapy with cannabis-based medicines should be terminated. SIGNIFICANCE This position paper provides expert recommendations for nonspecialist and specialist healthcare professionals in Europe, on the importance and the appropriate use of cannabis-based medicines as part of a multidisciplinary approach to pain management, in properly selected and supervised patients.},

  abstract = {Summary Restrictive gender norms and gender inequalities are replicated and reinforced in health systems, contributing to gender inequalities in health. In this Series paper, we explore how to address all three through recognition and then with disruptive solutions. We used intersectional feminist theory to guide our systematic reviews, qualitative case studies based on lived experiences, and quantitative analyses based on cross-sectional and evaluation research. We found that health systems reinforce patients' traditional gender roles and neglect gender inequalities in health, health system models and clinic-based programmes are rarely gender responsive, and women have less authority as health workers than men and are often devalued and abused. With regard to potential for disruption, we found that gender equality policies are associated with greater representation of female physicians, which in turn is associated with better health outcomes, but that gender parity is insufficient to achieve gender equality. We found that institutional support and respect of nurses improves quality of care, and that women's empowerment collectives can increase health-care access and provider responsiveness. We see promise from social movements in supporting women's reproductive rights and policies. Our findings suggest we must view gender as a fundamental factor that predetermines and shapes health systems and outcomes. Without addressing the role of restrictive gender norms and gender inequalities within and outside health systems, we will not reach our collective ambitions of universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals. We propose action to systematically identify and address restrictive gender norms and gender inequalities in health systems.},

Yet, even people without SAD sometimes fear and avoid certain social situations without ever developing the disorder. Apart from differences in number and severity, uncertainty abounds about how fear and avoidance of distinct interpersonal and social evaluative situations organize differently in people with and without SAD. Inspired by novel network approaches to psychopathology, we sought to characterize the network structure of fear and avoidance of distinct social evaluative situations among individuals with (n\,=\,238) and without SAD (n\,=\,232). Although the network structure and node centrality metrics did not differ between the groups, the network for those with SAD was more strongly interconnected than that of people free of the diagnosis. This study is the first to provide evidence that SAD can be conceptualized as a densely interconnected network of fear and avoidance of social situations. Our results are consistent with the network theory of mental disorders that regards networks with strong between-symptom connections as more pathogenic than similar networks with weaker connections. As prior studies indicated that overall network connectivity can predict the course of mental disorders, our findings set the scene for novel indicators of SAD prognosis.},

We explored injecting and non-injecting drug use by sexual behaviour among people who inject drugs (PWID) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Methods: Data were used from an unlinked-anonymous survey of PWID (2013\textendash 2016), where participants recruited through services self-completed a questionnaire. We included sexually active participants who had injected in the previous year, and compared injecting and non-injecting drug use between men reporting sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual men, and between women reporting sex with women (WSW) and heterosexual women. The questionnaire did not include GHB/GBL and methamphetamine use. Results: There were 299 MSM, 3215 heterosexual male, 122 WSW and 1336 heterosexual female participants. MSM were more likely than heterosexual men to use drugs associated with chemsex: injected or non-injected mephedrone (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.22, 95\%CI 1.54\textendash 3.22; AOR 2.15, 95\%CI 1.48\textendash 3.11) and injected or noninjected ketamine (AOR 1.98, 95\%CI 1.29\textendash 3.05; AOR 2.57, 95\%CI 1.59\textendash 4.15). MSM were also more likely to inject methadone, inhale solvents, take ecstasy, cocaine or speed. WSW were more likely than heterosexual women to use non-injected mephedrone (AOR 2.19, 95\%CI 1.20\textendash 3.99) and use injected or non-injected ketamine (AOR 5.58, 95\%CI 2.74\textendash 11.4; AOR 3.05, 95\%CI 1.30\textendash 7.19). WSW were also more likely to inject methadone, inject cocaine, use non-injected cocaine, crack, benzodiazepines or ecstasy, inhale solvents, or smoke cannabis. Conclusion: Injecting and non-injecting drug use differed between MSM/WSW and heterosexual men and women. The use of drugs that have been associated with chemsex and sexualised drug use is more common among both MSM and WSW than heterosexual men and women.},

Objectives: To understand the reasons why patients confronted with a medical problem perceived as urgent choose to consult either a GP or an ED. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study in Switzerland, using data collected between 2014 and 2015 through semi-structured interviews of adults with non-vital medical problems. Half were recruited after an ambulatory consultation in an ED, and half were patients who consulted their GP. The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed, coded, and analysed according to the constant comparative method. Results: The main reason given by patients who consulted their GP first was the quality of the relationship. The more meaningful the relationship, the more likely patients were to seek advice from their GP. One marker of a privileged relationship was GPs supplying their mobile phone number to the patient. The perceived nature of the complaint, for example, symptoms considered as life-threatening or severe pain, together with the expected waiting time in an ED were additional factors influencing the patients' choice. Conclusion: Our study showed that when patients are confronted with what they perceive as a medical emergency, the quality of the relationship with the GP, in particular the continuity of care provided, seem to be the major reasons why they consult their GP rather than an ED.},

Half (51.2\%) of women reported CSA and 71.2\% reported adult sexual victimization. Perpetrators were generally male, and 56.4\% of women's most recent adult sexual victimization incidents occurred after coming out. Regression results indicated that adult sexual victimization severity was associated with a bisexual identity, more severe CSA history, more lifetime sexual partners, and higher alcohol severity scores. Compared to lesbians, bisexual women reported more severe adult sexual victimization experiences, greater revictimization, riskier drinking patterns, and more lifetime male sexual partners. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2013.},

However, a focus on resiliencies within this population may greatly benefit health promotion. We describe a pattern of resilience (internalized homophobia (IHP) resolution) over the life-course and its associations with current health outcomes. 1,541 gay and bisexual men from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort study, an ongoing prospective study of the natural and treated histories of HIV, completed a survey about life-course events thought to be related to health. The majority of men resolved IHP over time independent of demographics. Men who resolved IHP had significantly higher odds of positive health outcomes compared to those who did not. These results provide evidence of resilience among participants that is associated with positive health outcomes. Understanding resiliencies and incorporating them into interventions may help to promote health and well-being among gay and bisexual men. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {Men who have sex with men (MSM) in the US experience great disparities in health outcomes, most notably in HIV. This dissertation will take a look at these disparities and offer a framework for understanding their etiology and for understanding the processes by which these disparities are sustained, propagated and eventually broken down. First, we provide an overview of the literature regarding health disparities among MSM and the current theories that exist to understand where these disparities come from. Specifically, we focus on Syndemics Theory and the Theory of Syndemic Production as the best models for understanding health among MSM. Finally, we suggest a new theoretical model, Cultural Resilience Theory, which can be used to conceptualize health promotion within the syndemic framework. We also test components of Syndemics Theory - interaction and mediation - that until now have functioned as assumed premises with no empirical support for their assertion. Finally, we test Cultural Resilience Theory as a model that can be used in prevention programming to break down syndemic processes among MSM. In the final chapter we look into the practical implications of Cultural Resilience Theory as it applies to the prevention (or abatement) of health disparities among MSM.The findings of this study have great public health significance and important implications for HIV prevention among MSM. First, the synergism analysis is the first to test the assertion that co-occurring psychosocial health conditions interact to increase HIV risk among MSM. These results suggest that there is a synergistic effect present. Likewise, the mediation analysis is the first to test the theory of syndemic production that states that early life adversity impacts HIV outcomes through syndemic processes; an assertion that was supported by these analyses. These two studies further our understanding of how syndemics function within MSM to produce health disparities. Finally, we identify several variables that break down syndemic processes through either their negative association with poor health outcomes, or by buffering the pathways from adversity to HIV risk through syndemics. These results will provide the foundation upon which a culturally tailored Theory of Cultural Resilience among MSM can be developed.},

METHODS: Participants were 1551 men from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study enrolled at 4 study sites: Baltimore, Maryland-Washington, DC; Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Participants who attended semiannual visits from April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2009, completed an additional survey that captured data about events throughout their life course thought to be related to syndemic production. RESULTS: Using multivariate analysis, we found that the majority of life-course predictor variables (e.g., victimization, internalized homophobia) were significantly associated with both the syndemic condition and the component psychosocial health outcomes (depressive symptoms, stress, stimulant use, sexual compulsivity, intimate partner violence). A nested negative binomial analysis showed that the overall life course significantly explained variability in the syndemic outcomes ({$\chi$}(2) = 247.94; P {$<$} .001; df = 22). CONCLUSIONS: We identified life-course events and conditions related to syndemic production that may help to inform innovative interventions that will effectively disentangle interconnecting health problems and promote health among MSM.},

Participants were 470 ethnically diverse YMSM ages 18 to 24 recruited between 2005 and 2006 and surveyed every 6~months for 24~months. Regression analyses examined the impact of adversity on syndemics (emotional distress, substance use, and problematic alcohol use) and the effects of both adversity and syndemics on HIV risk behaviors over time. Gay-related discrimination and victimization-among other adversity variables-were significantly associated with syndemics and condomless sex (CS). Syndemics mediated the effects of adversity on CS in all models. Adverse events impact HIV risk taking among YMSM through syndemics. These findings suggest that prevention programs aimed at reducing adversity may reduce both the synergistic effect of multiple psychosocial health problems and HIV risk taking.},

This article describes the general principles of mapping methodology by using illustrations derived from our experience conducting an evidence map of interventions for youth mental-health disorders. Methods Evidence maps are based on an explicit research question relating to the field of enquiry, which may vary in depth, but should be informed by end-users. The research question then drives the search for, and collection of, appropriate studies utilizing explicit and reproducible methods at each stage. This includes clear definition of components of the research question, development of a thorough and reproducible search strategy, development of explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria, and transparent decisions about the level of information to be obtained from each study. Discussion Evidence mapping is emerging as a rigorous methodology for gathering and disseminating up-to-date information to end-users. Thoughtful planning and assessment of available resources (e.g. staff, time, budget) are required by those applying this methodology to their particular field of clinical enquiry given the potential scope of the work. The needs of the end-user need to be balanced with available resources. Information derived needs to be effectively communicated, with the uptake of that evidence into clinical practice the ultimate aim. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Authors.

Design Population based cohort study. Setting United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Participants A cohort of 992 061 patients newly treated with antihypertensive drugs between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2015 was identified and followed until 31 December 2016. Main outcome measures Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios with 95\% confidence intervals of incident lung cancer associated with the time varying use of ACEIs, compared with use of angiotensin receptor blockers, overall, by cumulative duration of use, and by time since initiation. Results The cohort was followed for a mean of 6.4 (SD 4.7) years, generating 7952 incident lung cancer events (crude incidence 1.3 (95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.3) per 1000 person years). Overall, use of ACEIs was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (incidence rate 1.6 v 1.2 per 1000 person years; hazard ratio 1.14, 95\% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.29), compared with use of angiotensin receptor blockers. Hazard ratios gradually increased with longer durations of use, with an association evident after five years of use (hazard ratio 1.22, 1.06 to 1.40) and peaking after more than 10 years of use (1.31, 1.08 to 1.59). Similar findings were observed with time since initiation. Conclusions In this population based cohort study, the use of ACEIs was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. The association was particularly elevated among people using ACEIs for more than five years. Additional studies, with long term follow-up, are needed to investigate the effects of these drugs on incidence of lung cancer.},

Among MSM who engaged in group sexual encounters, we compared their past-60-day sexual behaviors in one-on-one encounters and group sexual encounters. We also compared risk profiles and syndemic production between men who did and did not participate in group sex. RESULTS: Men reporting a group-sex encounter had significantly higher polydrug use and sexual risk than did the men not reporting group sex in the past 60 days. The odds of engaging in group sex with 4 or more sexual partners significantly increased with the number of psychosocial problems, supporting evidence of syndemic production. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a particularly high-risk subgroup in the MSM population with considerable psychosocial problems that may be reached online. Research is needed on how to engage these high-risk men in combination prevention interventions.},

Twenty semistructured interviews were conducted (August\textendash November 2016) to assess opinions of and perceived barriers to accessing and adopting PrEP among MSM residing in Oklahoma. Participants perceived substantial barriers to access-ing PrEP including a stigmatizing environment and less access to quality, LGBT-sensitive medical care. Overall, geographic isolation limits access to health providers and resources that support sexual health for Oklahoma MSM. Addressing stigma situated across ecological levels in an effort to in-crease adoption of PrEP by MSM residing in rural states remains necessary. Without this, social determinants may continue to negatively influence PrEP adoption and sexual health outcomes. HIV remains a public health concern within the United States.

Much concerted research efforts and dedicated work have led to the achievement of very low rates of PMTCT of HIV in settings that can implement optimal prophylaxis. Though several implementation challenges remain, global elimination of pediatric HIV infection seems now more than ever to be an attainable goal. Often overlooked, the role of prophylaxis of the newborn is nevertheless a very important component of PMTCT. In this paper, we focus on the role of neonatal and infant prophylaxis, discuss mechanisms of protection, and present the clinical trial-generated evidence that led to the current recommendations for preventing infections in breastfed and non-breastfed infants. PMTCT of HIV should not end at birth; a continuum of care extending postpartum and postnatally is required to minimize the risk of new pediatric HIV infections.},

The literature on management and health outcomes of TW has grown recently with more publication of research. This has coincided with increasing awareness of gender diversity as communities around the world identify and address health disparities among trans people. In this narrative review, we aim to comprehensively summarize health considerations for TW and identify TW-related research areas that will provide answers to remaining unknowns surrounding TW's health. We cover up-to-date information on: (1) feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT); (2) benefits associated with GAHT, particularly quality of life, mental health, breast development and bone health; (3) potential risks associated with GAHT, including cardiovascular disease and infertility; and (4) other health considerations like HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, other tumours, voice therapy, dermatology, the brain and cognition, and aging. Although equally deserving of mention, feminizing gender-affirming surgery, paediatric and adolescent populations, and gender nonbinary individuals are beyond the scope of this review. While much of the data we discuss come from Europe, the creation of a United States transgender cohort has already contributed important retrospective data that are also summarized here. Much remains to be determined regarding health considerations for TW. Patients and providers will benefit from larger and longer prospective studies involving TW, particularly regarding the effects of aging, race and ethnicity, type of hormonal treatment (e.g. different oestrogens, anti-androgens) and routes of administration (e.g. oral, parenteral, transdermal) on all the topics we address.},

  author = {Jackson, Nicholas},
  address = {{US}},
  abstract = {Gay men in the United States demonstrate higher prevalence of lifetime substance use as compared to heterosexual men and women. This population is particularly vulnerable to the use of crystal methamphetamine, an illegal synthetic stimulant with a high risk for dependence and a number of negative sequelae. The relationship between the epidemic levels of the use of this drug and the epidemic levels of HIV infection among gay men will be considered within the framework of the syndemic model, which considers the complex interaction between co-occurring epidemics operating within particular communities and the range of biopsychosocial factors contributing to their prevalence. The literature to this point has primarily taken a deficit-based approach to this particular syndemic without fully considering the role of resilience among those gay men who are able to engage in the process of recovering from the use of crystal methamphetamine and managing the risk of the ongoing HIV epidemic. In order to better understand resilience, which is here defined as process of overcoming the negative effects of risk exposure, successfully coping with traumatic or adverse experiences, and avoiding the negative outcomes associated with risk, the author interviewed six gay men living in the Chicago area who have been engaged in abstinence-based recovery for a period of 5 to 31 years following their use of crystal methamphetamine. The individuals were interviewed over the course of approximately 3 months, with a focus on the dimensions of resilience they identified as important to their ongoing recovery. The themes of resilience identified from these interviews include a variety of adaptive responses to managing vulnerability to ongoing the HIV-epidemic such as safer sex practices as well as the importance of cultivating interpersonal and sexual relationships as well as community connection to maintain abstinence-based recovery -- especially, for several participants, establishing a connection the gay leather community. Participants also identified a willingness to change, effective shame management, cultivating an awareness of personal resilience, and embracing various forms of spiritual growth and meaning-making. These themes offer a starting point for mental health clinicians interested in assisting gay male clients in recovery from crystal methamphetamine use to find ways to harness and nurture resilience in their abstinence-based recovery processes.

  abstract = {Background: Research shows that sexual minorities (e.g., lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals) experience higher levels of discrimination, stigma, and stress and are at higher risk of some poor health outcomes and health behaviors compared to their heterosexual counterparts. However, the majority of studies have examined sexual orientation disparities in a narrow range of health outcomes and behaviors using convenience samples comprised of either men or women living in restricted geographic areas. Methods: To investigate the relationship between sexual orientation identity and health among U.S. women and men, we used Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate prevalence ratios for health behaviors, outcomes, and services use comparing sexual minorities to heterosexual individuals using 2013 and 2014 National Health Interview Survey data (N = 69,270). Results: Three percent of the sample identified as sexual minorities. Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian (prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.65 [95 \% confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 2.37]) and bisexual (PR = 2.16 [1.46, 3.18]) women were more likely to report heavy drinking. Lesbians had a higher prevalence of obesity (PR = 1.20 [1.02, 1.42]), stroke (PR = 1.96 [1.14, 3.39]), and functional limitation (PR = 1.17 [1.02, 1.34] than heterosexual women. Gay men were more likely to have hypertension (PR = 1.21 [1.03, 1.43]) and heart disease (PR = 1.39 [1.02, 1.88]). Despite no difference in health insurance status, sexual minorities were more likely than heterosexual individuals to delay seeking healthcare because of cost; however, members of this group were also more likely to have received an HIV test and initiated HPV vaccination. Conclusion: Sexual minorities had a higher prevalence of some poor health behaviors and outcomes.},

As part of a larger study of the syndemic of HIV, substance use, and mental health among young sexual minority men in New York City, we sought to explore what sexual minority men know about HPV and the HPV vaccine, along with their experiences have been communicating about the virus and vaccine. We interviewed 38 young sexual minority men with diverse sociodemographic characteristics and identified three main themes: low knowledge about HPV infection and vaccination, highly gendered misconceptions about HPV only affecting women, and lack of communication from healthcare providers about HPV. The prevalence of incorrect HPV knowledge, coupled with inadequate education and vaccination in healthcare settings, indicates a missed opportunity for HPV prevention in a high-risk and high-need population.},

Recently, sex chromosome discordant chimerism detected prenatally has been reported where no phenotypic abnormality was found postnatally. We now report the finding of high-level sex chromosome discordant chimerism in a healthy pregnant 46-year-old female with two previous healthy daughters. 46XX and 46XY cell lines were detected in blood and from the buccal mucosa and chimerism was confirmed by examination of a panel of microsatellite markers.

Respondents who perceived their HIV risk to be low possessed the least HIV knowledge. There were interethnic differences in the frequency of gay sauna visits, sex-seeking on mobile applications, drug use and attendance at sex parties. Respondents reported a high frequency of racism and discrimination, with Black MSM reporting highest frequency., CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to raise awareness of HIV in BME MSM, and a culturally competent approach to HIV awareness-raising in BME MSM is required. These findings shed light on the contexts in which HIV prevention efforts should be targeted to reach specific ethnic groups, as well as some of the potential syndemics that can increase HIV risk or undermine HIV outcomes in BME MSM patients.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the author attempts to build a critical analysis of the interconnections between chemsex, drugs, sexual promiscuity and male sexual violence. The notion of power is understood within the context of chemsex, along with issues of drug taking and sexual promiscuity since these activities often manifest in chemsex settings. By formulating a theoretical and conceptual analysis, drawing on hegemonic masculinity and normative heterosexuality as theoretical and conceptual frameworks to elucidate some links between chemsex, drug taking, sexual promiscuity and male sexual violence, it is argued that the contexts in which chemsex occurs also give rise to male sexual assault and male rape in that the likelihood of these crimes occurring increases. This work is not (nor could it) generalize to a population. The slow upsurge of writing around male sexual victimisation has overlooked important and salient links between chemsex and male sexual violence. This paper offers a dialogue in which to speak about these links, encouraging future research on these important subject matters to contribute to knowledge in order to fully understand male rape. Making sense of these important links can provide some understanding of the personal, social and cultural implications associated with chemsex and male sexual violence. The current paper contributes to current debates in gender and sexuality studies, adding to current understandings of social and cultural constructions of masculinities and sexualities. Identifying the links between gender, sexualities, chemsex and male rape has largely been absent in gender and sexuality studies. The current paper makes these links to recognise and understand the different ways in which men navigate through different masculinities and sexualities, how they perpetuate or dispel hegemonic masculinity, and how men are positioned in certain masculinities in chemsex contexts. The paper considers the growing popularity of sexual practices that involve levels of drug use sufficient to pose tangible risks to those involved, which is clearly an important issue to highlight and to discuss.},

Among men who had sex with men, homonegative attitudes were associated with lower odds of condom use during anal sex with women (before the past year) and past-year STI testing. Among men who had sex with men and women, homonegative attitudes were associated with lower odds of condom use during vaginal sex and sex with men, having 4 or more partners, and HIV testing ever. Among men who had sex with women, homonegative attitudes were associated with lower odds of condom use during vaginal sex and sex with men (before the past year), HIV testing ever, and contracting herpes, human papillomavirus, or syphilis.Conclusions. Homonegative attitudes may promote HIV/STI acquisition and transmission among sexually active men of all sexual orientations. Interventions should address homonegative attitudes in the United States.},

  abstract = {Today humanity crucially needs to discover new natural resources, due to world population growth and high economic demand from the major emerging countries (China, India\ldots ). Just like energy resources, mineral resources constitute one of the key elements of the development of industrial economies. Due to soaring prices of raw materials and metals, together with the need to diversify supply sources, new deposits are being sought both on land and at sea. The ocean covers 71 \% of the Earth's surface (including 60 \% over 2,000 m deep), yet this vast area remains poorly known. Its wealth could become vital for global needs in terms of energy and raw materials. For a few years now, supply tensions have no longer only concerned base metals (copper, zinc, lead\ldots ), but also rare metals (rare earths, indium, platinum group metals (PGMs), gallium\ldots ) sometimes referred to as critical or strategic metals due to their expanding use in new technologies (electronics, military applications, clean energies\ldots ).},

This network analysis may identify the optimal set of venues for tailored interventions. It also suggests increasing difficulty of interrupting network transmission through fragmentation.},

This study aimed to test the synergistic effects of syndemic factors on HIV risk and to further explore the moderators between syndemics and HIV risk among Chinese MSM. A cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit MSM in Guangzhou to collect data on syndemic factors (depression, intimate partner violence, childhood sexual abuse [CSA], alcohol, and rush popper use before anal sex). The relative excess risk due to interactions (RERIs) was calculated to test the synergy in adjusted regression models. A moderated analysis was conducted to test the buffer effects of potential resilience factors (education and income). Among the 976 included MSM, individuals experiencing more syndemic factors were more likely to have CAI (odds ratio [OR]=\,1.26, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.44), MSP (OR=\,1.33, 95\% CI 1.16-1.52), and HIV infection (OR=\,1.46, 95\% CI 1.12-1.90). RERIs showed a synergy of depression\,and\,rush popper use prior to sex for MSP (1.17, 95\% CI 0.03-2.03) and CSA\,and\,rush popper use prior to sex for HIV infection (1.72, 95\% CI 0.05-3.43). However, no significant association was found for the interaction between the number of syndemic factors and education or income. Our findings support the synergy approach in syndemic studies and highlight the need for comprehensive and multifactorial intervention strategies on sexual health of MSM. Future studies are needed to identify potential resilience factors among Chinese MSM.},

Together, these problems comprise a syndemic that increases the risk of HIV infection for this community. The precise mechanisms through which this syndemic can raise the likelihood of HIV infection warrant further exploration. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 522 MSM were enrolled via a multiframe sampling approach and were asked to report psychosocial problems, risky sexual behaviors and HIV test results. A count of psychosocial health problems was calculated to test the additive relationship of these factors on HIV risk. Adjusting analysis and restriction analysis were used to determine a proposed intermediate pathway. Psychosocial health problems are highly concurrent and intercorrelated among urban MSM. Greater numbers of health problems are significantly and positively associated with HIV infection, which is mediated, at least partially, by risky sexual behaviors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MSM experience concurrent psychosocial health problems that correlate with HIV infection in this community. We recommend the development of coping strategies for this population to deal with these psychosocial problems, both in prevention research and health policy.},

Documented sex/gender differ- ences in the brain are often taken as support of a sexually dimorphic view of human brains (``female brain'' or ``male brain''). However, such a distinction would be possible only if sex/gender differences in brain features were highly dimorphic (i.e., little overlap between the forms of these features in males and females) and internally consistent (i.e., a brain has only ``male'' or only ``female'' features). Here, analysis of MRIs of more than 1,400 human brains from four datasets reveals extensive overlap between the distributions of females and males for all gray matter,whitematter, and connections assessed.Moreover, analyses of internal consistency reveal that brains with features that are consistently at one end of the ``maleness-femaleness'' continuum are rare. Rather, most brains are comprised of unique ``mosaics'' of features, somemore common in females compared withmales, some more common inmales compared with females, and some common in both females and males. Our findings are robust across sample, age, type of MRI, andmethod of analysis. These findings are corroborated by a similar analysis of personality traits, attitudes, interests, and be- haviors of more than 5,500 individuals, which reveals that internal consistency is extremely rare. Our study demonstrates that, although there are sex/gender differences in the brain, human brains do not belong to one of two distinct categories: male brain/female brain.},

Although several studies have noted higher rates and negative consequence of sexual violence in bisexual women, few have attempted to unravel the connections between bisexuality and victimization. In this theoretical article, the authors offer several potential explanatory variables as well as a call for more in-depth research into the unique risks suffered by bisexual women of all races. Drawing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ecological model of sexual violence and multiple fields of research, the authors map the potential origins and explanations of these risks by connecting the sexual violence literature with research into heteronormativity and homo/ biphobia, studies of intimate partner violence, cultural analyses of media representation of women's sexuality, and contemporary understandings of trauma following sexual violence victimization.},

  abstract = {Recent biomedical advances in HIV prevention strategies such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and achieving an undetectable viral load (UVL) support evidence-based scientific studies indicating that HIV transmission rates can continue to be reduced through campaigns such as 'Getting to Zero'. Despite the new evidence there continue to be disparities in risk and in access to prevention strategies based on a number of social, cultural, and economic factors collectively noted here as Syndemic Impact (the co-constitutive epidemiological factors in large urban areas where the social and biological intersect). Syndemic Impact, when coupled with Internal Traumatic Gay Men's Syndrome (the inter-generational, socially-isolating and traumatic life changing experiences that shape risk for HIV and overall long-term health outcomes for gay Indigenous men of mixed ancestry), can help to explain the ongoing social and cultural impact of trauma on health outcomes for both negative and positive self-identified American Indian and Indigenous gay men. Previous studies (Diaz 1997; Cohen 1999; Vernon 2001; Jolivette 2016) have shown the socio-cultural and socio-psychological impact of identity factors such as race, religion, and economic status on the mental health of gay men of colour. Among American Indians, First Nations, Aboriginal, and Alaska Native gay men we must also incorporate an analysis of ITGMS, Indigenous Capital, and Queer Indigenous Citizenship to explore how social and cultural interactions influence health, wellness, and community inclusion in national and global contexts for queer Indigenous and two-spirit identified men. In addition to ITGMS, this article also examines theories of structural capital, decolonisation, and Queer Indigenous Citizenship (QIC) as routes to articulate a new theory of Indigenous Capital in order to address the gaps in cultural competency approaches in reducing the impact of stigma and community exclusion among gay American Indian and Indigenous men. Engagement with QIC will lead to greater efforts towards meaningful decolonisation in Indigenous communities on a global scale by centring queer Indigenous knowledge production.},

  abstract = {Recently, researchers in clinical psychology have endeavored to create network models of the relationships between symptoms, both within and across mental disorders. Symptoms that connect two mental disorders are called "bridge symptoms." Unfortunately, no formal quantitative methods for identifying these bridge symptoms exist. Accordingly, we developed four network statistics to identify bridge symptoms: bridge strength, bridge betweenness, bridge closeness, and bridge expected influence. These statistics are nonspecific to the type of network estimated, making them potentially useful in individual-level psychometric networks, group-level psychometric networks, and networks outside the field of psychopathology such as social networks. We first tested the fidelity of our statistics in predicting bridge nodes in a series of simulations. Averaged across all conditions, the statistics achieved a sensitivity of 92.7\% and a specificity of 84.9\%. By simulating datasets of varying sample sizes, we tested the robustness of our statistics, confirming their suitability for network psychometrics. Furthermore, we simulated the contagion of one mental disorder to another, showing that deactivating bridge nodes prevents the spread of comorbidity (i.e., one disorder activating another). Eliminating nodes based on bridge statistics was more effective than eliminating nodes high on traditional centrality statistics in preventing comorbidity. Finally, we applied our algorithms to 18 group-level empirical comorbidity networks from published studies and discussed the implications of this analysis.},

Evidence points to blood exposure during sex as the medium of hepatitis C virus transmission. Hepatitis C virus prevalence among HIV + MSM overall and in relation to injection drug use is poorly characterized. In this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis examining global hepatitis C virus antibody prevalence and estimating active hepatitis C virus prevalence among HIV + MSM were conducted; 42 reports provided anti-hepatitis C virus prevalence data among HIV + MSM. Pooled prevalence produced an overall anti-hepatitis C virus prevalence among HIV + MSM of 8.1\%; active HCV prevalence estimate was 5.3\%-7.3\%. Anti-hepatitis C virus prevalence among injection drug use and non-injection drug use HIV + MSM was 40.0\% and 6.7\%, respectively. Among HIV + MSM, hepatitis C virus prevalence increased significantly over time among the overall and non-injection drug use groups, and decreased significantly among injection drug use HIV + MSM. We identified a moderate prevalence of hepatitis C virus among all HIV + MSM and among non-injection drug use HIV + MSM; for both, prevalence was observed to be increasing slightly. Pooled prevalence of hepatitis C virus among HIV + MSM was higher than that observed in the 1945-1965 US birth cohort. The modest but rising hepatitis C virus prevalence among HIV + MSM suggests an opportunity to control HCV among HIV + MSM; this combined with data demonstrating a rising hepatitis C virus incidence highlights the temporal urgency to do so.},

New highly sensitive screening methods can identify early stages of retinopathy, and studies that include these modalities have indicated a substantially higher prevalence of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy than was previously recognized, resulting in revisions to ophthalmology guidelines and the recommendation of a low dose of hydroxychloroquine for many patients. However, the efficacy of low-dose hydroxychloroquine for treating SLE and other rheumatic diseases is unknown. Further studies are required to establish the effectiveness and retinal safety of the latest hydroxychloroquine treatment recommendations.},

  abstract = {During the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, most of the developed world instituted a permanent ban on blood donations from men who have sex with men (MSM). In recent years, public health agencies across Europe and North America are reconsidering and rescinding these restrictions. We examine the Canadian climate, where MSM may donate blood only after a 5-year deferral period. We review circumstances of the initial ban on MSM blood donations and recent social, legal, and economic changes that have encouraged Canadian public health officials to consider policy reform. We also review international evidence about the impact of reforming MSM blood donations. Given improvements in HIV screening technology, results from mathematical modeling studies, and empirical data from Italy, the UK, and Australia, we conclude that changing Canada's MSM blood donation policy from a 5- to a 1-year deferral would not increase the number of transfusion-transmitted HIV infections. We provide empirical support to the recently elected Liberal Canadian government's political promise to decrease restrictions on MSM blood donations.},

  abstract = {For over 25 years the varying idealizations of gay men's bodies and the behaviors associated with achieving such bodies has been the focus of an increasingly large body of research. What first constituted an idealized body in this research, in the 1980s, was a thin and youthful image, which evolved into a muscular ideal in the 2000s with thinness translated into lean muscle mass and a small waist. To account for the emergence of both body image dissatisfaction and eating disorders, researchers in both paradigms have tended to either pathologize gay men or speculate about the contribution of a range of social-cultural and psychological factors. These include the role of the gay community, being effeminate or less masculine, and internalized homophobia. HIV and the ``wasted'' body is claimed to have also influenced the purported recent emergence of the muscular ideal. The underlying driver for both paradigms is the proposition that gay men are universally fixated on their appearance and presenting an idealized body to other men. This critical review examines the fault lines in both paradigms that can be found within prevalence studies, the methodology, data analysis, and the contradictory and problematic theorizing that arise as a result. It concludes that the prevalence and the truth of gay men's body image issues are overstated.},

However, our results showed that online self-disclosure moderates the postulated relationships. That is, excessive smartphone use (time 1 [T1]) predicts increased stress (T2), for those smartphone users who do engage in little online self-disclosure. However, for those who communicate their feelings, anxieties, and problems online, excessive smartphone use (T1) can even reduce loneliness (T2) and relieve stress (T2).},

  abstract = {The HIV care continuum is a framework that models the dynamic stages of HIV care. The continuum consists of five main steps, which, at the population level, are depicted cross-sectionally as the HIV treatment cascade. These steps include diagnosis, linkage to care (LTC), retention in care (RiC), adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral suppression. Although the HIV treatment cascade is represented as a linear, unidirectional framework, persons living with HIV (PLWH) often experience the care continuum in a less streamlined fashion, skip steps altogether, or even exit the continuum for a period of time and regress to an earlier stage. The proportion of PLWH decreases at each successive step of the cascade, beginning with an estimated 86\% who are diagnosed and dropping dramatically to approximately 30\% of PLWH who are virally suppressed in the United States (US). In this current issues review, we describe each step in the cascade, discuss targeted interventions that address weak points in the continuum, review domestic and international policies that help shape and direct HIV care strategies, and conclude with recommendations and future directions for HIV providers and policymakers. While we primarily examine issues related to domestic HIV care in the US, we also discuss international applications of the continuum in order to provide broader context.},

  abstract = {Research into how people living with HIV or AIDS (PLWHA) experience and make sense of feared or actual body changes, such as lipodystrophy, is limited. The present study conducted in-depth interviews with gay men living with HIV. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) yielded themes across five domains. The ambiguity of early-stage lipodystrophy was a cause of distress. There was a drive to detect changes early, leading to anxiety, uncertainty and negative feelings about the body as well as possible misperception of change. In later stages, lipodystrophy was felt to be highly distinctive. Participants struggled to live with a shape that transgressed a body ideal. Feelings of loss of control were evident in both the increased ineffectiveness of strategies to maintain a desirable appearance and in the tendency for such changes to act as a visible marker of status. Conflicting feelings emerged in ideas of thinness and of health, with loss of fat seen as desirable in certain contexts. The study builds on previous research suggesting that the high value of appearance, particularly within gay communities, may lead to extreme compensatory behaviours. HIV places increased risk on a group highly vulnerable to body dissatisfaction and eating disorders. The study concludes with a cognitive-behavioural model of body image for PLWHA and suggestions for intervention. Further research is needed to validate the model and investigate whether the findings are generalisable. However, body image concerns should be acknowledged when addressing HIV-related health.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Studies about sexual functioning in trans persons have mainly focused on sexual functioning after genital gender-affirming surgery, have had small sample sizes, and have not explored the broad range of possible sexual dysfunctions. Measuring sexual functioning in trans persons during transitioning is important to determine the kind of care trans persons may need in order to regain their sexual health. Aim: The first aim of the present study was to explore the prevalence of sexual function disturbances and dysfunctions (with distress) in trans women and trans men 4 to 6 years after initial clinical entry. The second aim was to compare the prevalence of sexual dysfunctions among the various treatment trajectories and between trans persons with or without further genital treatment intentions. Methods: An online follow-up questionnaire was filled out by 518 trans persons (307 identifying predominantly feminine, 211 identifying predominantly masculine) as a part of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence initiative. All participants had their initial clinical appointments in gender clinics in Ghent, Amsterdam, or Hamburg. Main Outcome Measure: The main outcome measures were the prevalence of sexual dysfunctions and medical treatment data, measured via self-report items. Results: The most frequent sexual dysfunctions experienced by trans women and trans men were difficulties initiating and seeking sexual contact (26\% and 32\%, respectively) and difficulties achieving an orgasm (29\% and 15\%, respectively). Compared with trans women after hormone treatment and non-genital surgery, trans women after vaginoplasty less often experienced arousal difficulties, sexual aversion, and low sexual desire. Compared with trans men without medical treatment, trans men after a phalloplasty experienced sexual aversion and low sexual desire less often. No significant differences were found between participants with or without further genital treatment intentions. Clinical implications: Clinicians should consider sexual counseling after medical treatments, paying particular attention to potential social and psychological barriers to the sexual health of their patients. Strengths \& Limitations: This study included all trans persons irrespective of treatment decisions, and focused on a broad range of potential sexual difficulties taking the distress criteria into account. Limitations include the cross-sectional design, the limited power for the comparison of treatment groups and the absence of validated questionnaires about sexual functioning for transgender persons. Conclusion: Sexual dysfunctions among trans men and women were very common among the various treatment groups and were unrelated to intentions to have further genital treatment. Although medical treatment may be helpful or even essential to developing good sexual health, a significant group of trans persons experienced sexual dysfunctions after genital surgery.

We searched Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cinahl, the Cochrane Library Database, the Web of Knowledge, the Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Sociological Abstracts, the Campbell Collaboration and grey literature databases for articles published January 1966 to April 2005. We also used Google and Google Scholar and contacted authors where necessary. We searched all terms related to homosexual, lesbian and bisexual people and all terms related to mental disorders, suicide, and deliberate self harm. We included papers on population based studies which contained concurrent heterosexual comparison groups and valid definition of sexual orientation and mental health outcomes.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Of 13706 papers identified, 476 were initially selected and 28 (25 studies) met inclusion criteria. Only one study met all our four quality criteria and seven met three of these criteria. Data was extracted on 214,344 heterosexual and 11,971 non heterosexual people. Meta-analyses revealed a two fold excess in suicide attempts in lesbian, gay and bisexual people [pooled risk ratio for lifetime risk 2.47 (CI 1.87, 3.28)]. The risk for depression and anxiety disorders (over a period of 12 months or a lifetime) on meta-analyses were at least 1.5 times higher in lesbian, gay and bisexual people (RR range 1.54-2.58) and alcohol and other substance dependence over 12 months was also 1.5 times higher (RR range 1.51-4.00). Results were similar in both sexes but meta analyses revealed that lesbian and bisexual women were particularly at risk of substance dependence (alcohol 12 months: RR 4.00, CI 2.85, 5.61; drug dependence: RR 3.50, CI 1.87, 6.53; any substance use disorder RR 3.42, CI 1.97-5.92), while lifetime prevalence of suicide attempt was especially high in gay and bisexual men (RR 4.28, CI 2.32, 7.88).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: LGB people are at higher risk of mental disorder, suicidal ideation, substance misuse, and deliberate self harm than heterosexual people.},

  abstract = {Purpose. This study examines the prevalence of alcohol-related problems, the factors underlying these problems, and whether or not there is evidence of syndemic effects in a community population of southern, urban African American women. Methods. Questionnaire-based interviews were conducted with 817 women, all African American, from 80 targeted census block groups in Atlanta, Georgia. Results. Most of the alcohol users (67.8\%) experienced at least one problem as a result of their alcohol (ab)use, with most women experiencing two or more such problems. Eight factors were found to be associated with experiencing more alcohol problems: being aged 30 or older, having had no recent health insurance, lower levels of educational attainment, self-identifying as lesbian or bisexual, experiencing greater amounts of childhood maltreatment, greater impulsivity, perceiving one's local community or neighborhood to be unsafe, and having a larger number of criminally involved friends. Conclusions. Drinking-related problems were prevalent in this population. Numerous factors underlie the extent to which African American women experienced problems resulting from their alcohol use. There is strong evidence of syndemic-type effects influencing drinking problems in this population, and future efforts to reduce the negative impact of alcohol (ab)use ought to consider the adoption of programs using a syndemics' theory approach.},

The principal aim is to provide an empirical test of the applicability of the theory to sexual risk behaviors in this particular research population. The study was based on a national random sample of 332 men who have sex with men, or MSM, who use the Internet to seek men with whom they can engage in unprotected sex. Data collection was conducted via telephone interviews between January 2008 and May 2009. As hypothesized in the syndemics theory model, attitudes toward condom use were central to understanding men's involvement in risky sex. As hypothesized, these attitudes depended on various demographic, psychological/psychosocial functioning, and sex-related preference measures. Also as hypothesized, psychological and psychosocial functioning were found to be very important to the overall model, and as expected, these factors were shaped greatly by factors such as demographic characteristics and childhood maltreatment experiences. The structural equation assessing the fit of the overall model indicated solid support for the syndemics theory approach. Overall, syndemics theory seems to apply fairly well to understanding the complexity of the factors that underlie men's risk-taking practices. The complicated interplay among factors such as attitudes toward condom use, childhood maltreatment experiences, psychological and psychosocial functioning, and substance use and abuse-all of which are central to a syndemics theory approach to studying risk-was demonstrated.},

It focuses on the relationship between condom use self-efficacy and risk involvement, and examines the factors associated with greater/lower levels of condom use self-efficacy. The data come from a national sample of men, randomly chosen, who used any of 16 websites specifically to identify other men with whom they could engage in unprotected sex. Data were collected between January 2008 and May 2009 from 332 men, via telephone interviews. Multivariate analyses and structural equation modeling were used to test a conceptual model based on syndemics theory. Overall levels of condom use self-efficacy were fairly high, and self-efficacy was related inversely to involvement in HIV risk practices. Six factors were found to be indicative of levels of condom use self-efficacy: the number of drug problems experienced, sexual role identity as a "bottom," not caring about the HIV serostatus of potential sex partners, experiencing childhood maltreatment, having confidence in HIV-related information provided in other men's online profiles, and level of HIV knowledge. Condom use self-efficacy plays an integral role in HIV risk practices among high-risk men who have sex with men. This is true despite the fact that, overall, condom use self-efficacy levels were fairly high in this population.},

Women who have sex with women may be at disproportionate risk of obesity, tobacco use, substance use, mental health issues, intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, and some cancers. Disparities can exist throughout the lifetime. Lesbian and bisexual adolescents are vulnerable to bullying, family rejection, and risky sexual behavior that may lead to sexually transmitted infections or unintended pregnancy. Sexual minority stress, which is a response to stigmatization, prejudice, and internalized homophobia, contributes to many of these conditions. Family physicians should foster trust and communication to provide a nonjudgmental, welcoming environment supportive of culturally competent health care and optimal outcomes. When indicated, clini-cians should refer women who have sex with women to culturally sensitive community resources and legal advisors for assistance with medical decision making, hospital visitation, conception, and legal recognition of nonbiologic parents.

The PubMed database was searched for all literature that assessed transgender medical education among physicians or trainees and all papers that reported results of transgender-specific educational interventions. Literature that only evaluated general lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) educational interventions was excluded. The lack of education in transgender care continues among providers across all levels of medical education from medical students and physician trainees to primary care providers, endocrinologists and other specialists involved in transgender care. Several interventions have been shown to effectively improve transgender knowledge and cultural competency. Education among healthcare providers is deficient and is considered a major barrier to care for transgender individuals. Effective interventions should be applied to fundamental medical education. Additional focused education also should be taught with specialty-appropriate content to produce needed proficiency among providers of transgender care.},

METHODS: The task force of the European Pain Federation (EFIC) conducted a survey with its national chapters representatives on the status of approval of all types of cannabis-based medicines, the covering of costs and the availability of a position paper of a national medical association on the use of medical cannabis for chronic pain and for symptom control in palliative/supportive care. RESULTS: Thirty-one out of 37 contacted councillors responded. Plant-derived tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD) oromucosal spray is approved for spasticity in multiple sclerosis refractory to conventional treatment in 21 EFIC chapters. Plant-derived THC (dronabinol) is approved for some palliative care conditions in four EFIC chapters. Synthetic THC analogue (nabilone) is approved for chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting refractory to conventional treatment in four EFIC chapters'. Eight EFIC chapters' countries have an exceptional and six chapters an expanded access programme for medical cannabis. German and Israeli pain societies recommend the use of cannabis-based medicines as third-line drug therapies for chronic pain within a multicomponent approach. Conversely, the German medical association and a team of finish experts and officials do not recommend the prescription of medical cannabis due to the lack of high-quality evidence of efficacy and the potential harms. CONCLUSIONS: There are marked differences between the countries represented in EFIC in the approval and availability of cannabis-based products for medical use. EFIC countries are encouraged to collaborate with the European Medicines Agency to publish a common document on cannabis-based medicines. SIGNIFICANCE: There are striking differences between European countries in the availability of plant-derived and synthetic cannabinoids and of medical cannabis for pain management and for symptom control in palliative care and in the covering of costs by health insurance companies or state social security systems.},

  abstract = {The field of transgender health continues to expand rapidly, including research in the area of family planning. While much attention has been given to fertility preservation and the parenting intentions of transgender individuals, far less has been paid to pregnancy prevention and contraceptive needs of people along the transmasculine gender spectrum (transgender men and gender-nonbinary persons who were assigned female at birth). Existing research illustrates that many clinicians and transmasculine individuals falsely believe that there is no risk of pregnancy while amenorrheic. These studies also show inconsistent counseling practices provided to transmasculine persons surrounding contraception and pregnancy while falling short of providing robust clinical guidance for improvement. Clinicians report a lack of adequate training in transgender reproductive health, and consequently, many do not feel comfortable treating transgender patients. The aim of this publication is to consolidate the findings of these prior studies and build upon them to offer comprehensive clinical guidance for managing contraception in transmasculine patients. To do so, it reviews the physiologic effects of testosterone on the sex steroid axis and current understanding of why ovulation and pregnancy may still occur while amenorrheic. Gender-inclusive terminology and a suggested script for eliciting a gender-affirming sexual history are offered. Common concerns (such as the effects on gender dysphoria and gender affirmation) and side effects of available contraceptive methods are subsequently addressed and how these may have a unique impact on transmasculine persons as compared with cisgender women. Lastly, a model is provided for approaching contraceptive counseling in the transmasculine population to assist clinicians and patients in determining the need for and selection of the type of contraception. To center transmasculine voices, the development of this publication's guidelines have been led by reproductive care clinicians of transgender experience.},

Cross-sectional data from 212 YLH, ages 16-29, collected between 2011-2014 in Chicago were analyzed to assess the relationship of multiple psychosocial conditions (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, moderate/heavy marijuana use, moderate/heavy alcohol use, HIV-related stigma) to ART adherence (i.e., a "syndemic.") Adherence was regressed on an index of increasing numbers of psychosocial conditions, controlling for demographic and treatment factors as well as enrollment site.

Recent research has focused on additional aspects of health risk disparities among gay and bisexual men, including depression and other mental health problems, childhood sexual abuse, and adult victimization, suggesting that these men are impacted by a syndemic of health risks. The involvement of gay and bisexual men with the criminal justice system is largely absent from the literature. This article describes the nature, extent and predictors of the arrest histories of a sample of gay and bisexual substance users at very high risk for HIV infection and/or transmission. These histories are surprisingly extensive, and are strongly associated with poverty, severe mental distress, substance abuse and dependence, and victimization. The involvement of gay and bisexual men in the criminal justice system deserves a stronger research focus because of the unique challenges facing such men and also because arrests are yet another marker for a host of health risks among them.},

For HIV-positive men, positive coping behaviors (P = .015) and coping self-efficacy (P = .014) predicted higher odds, and cognitive escape behaviors (P = .003) lower odds, of serosorting.

Utilizing masculinity as its theoretical frame, the authors use childhood experiences with both fathers and peers, the gay community's inculcation of heteronormative ideologies, and the gay media's adherence to masculine prototypes, to provide causal explanations for the appeal of muscular, lean, and athletic physiques. While the authors acknowledge that not all individuals within the gay community look toward muscularity and athleticism as the primary components of attractiveness, it nonetheless remains important to examine the theoretical perspectives that may explain the appeal of this specific aesthetic.},

This study examined how differences in depressive symptoms between heterosexual and LGB youth developed from late childhood to early adulthood. The association between sexual orientation and depressive symptoms was estimated from age 11 to 22 using data from the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a longitudinal Dutch cohort study. Of the 1738 respondents (54.8 \% girls) that provided information on sexual orientation, 151 self-identified as LGB. In line with the Minority Stress Framework, it was tested whether self-reported peer victimization and parental rejection mediated the association between sexual orientation and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that LB girls and bisexuals were at increased risk of depressive symptoms already at age 11. The difference increased over time and was related to pubertal development in girls and bisexual individuals. Furthermore, self-reported peer victimization (for both boys and girls), as well as parental rejection (for girls/bisexuals), mediated the association between sexual orientation and depressive symptoms. The authors conclude that already in late childhood, associations between sexual orientation and depressive symptoms are found, partly due to minority stress mechanisms.},

No quantitative studies were found that assessed the relationships between HIV syndemics, religion, and spirituality. Nine studies, with 13 statistical analyses, were found that examined the relationships between individual HIV syndemics-related health conditions, religion, and spirituality. Among the 13 analyses, religion and spirituality were found to have mixed relationships with HIV syndemics-related health conditions (6 nonsignificant associations; 5 negative associations; 2 positive associations). Given the overall lack of inclusion of religion and spirituality in HIV syndemics research, a conceptual model that hypothesizes the potential interactions of religion and spirituality with HIV syndemics-related health conditions is presented. The implications of the model for MSM's health are outlined.},

Homophobic prejudice and stigma are often thought to underlie these disparities. In this study, the relationship between such experiences of social derogation and mental health and substance use in same-sex attracted young people was examined using Meyer's minority stress theory. An online survey recruited 254 young women and 318 young men who identified as same-sex attracted, were aged 18-25 years, and lived in Sydney, Australia. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that internalized homophobia, perceived stigma, and experienced homophobic physical abuse were associated with higher levels of psychological distress and self-reported suicidal thoughts in the previous month. Furthermore, perceived stigma and homophobic physical abuse were associated with reporting a lifetime suicide attempt. The association between minority stress and substance use was inconsistent. While, as expected, higher levels of perceived stigma were associated with club drug dependence, there was an inverse association between internalized homophobia and club drug use, and between perceived stigma and hazardous alcohol use. The findings of this study provide support for the minority stress theory proposition that chronic social stress due to sexual orientation is associated with poorer mental health. The high rates of mental health and substance use problems in the current study suggest that same-sex attracted young people should continue to be a priority population for mental health and substance use intervention and prevention.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual) populations have a higher prevalence of mental health and sub-stance use disorders compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Such disparities have been attributed, in part, to minority stressors, including distal stressors such as discrimination. However, few studies have examined asso-ciations between discrimination, mental health, and substance use disorders by gender among sexual minority populations. Methods: We analyzed data from 577 adult men and women who self-identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual and participated in Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Six questions assessed discrimination due to sexual orientation. Weighted multivariable logistic regression ex-amined associations between experiences of sexual orientation discrimination and both mental health and sub-stance use disorders. Analyses were conducted separately for sexual minority men and women, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Results: Sexual minority men who ever experienced discrimination (57.4\%) reported higher odds of any life-time drug use disorder and cannabis use disorder compared to sexual minority men who never experienced dis-crimination. Sexual minority women who ever experienced discrimination (42.9\%) reported higher odds of any lifetime mood disorder and any lifetime anxiety disorder compared to sexual minority women who never expe-rienced discrimination. Conclusion: The findings suggest that discrimination is differentially associated with internalizing (mental health) and externalizing (substance use) disorders for sexual minority men and women. These findings indicate a need to consider how homophobia and heteronormative discrimination may contribute to distinct health out-comes for lesbian and bisexual women compared with gay and bisexual men.},

Although the dynamic interplay among syndemic indicators is theorized to be crucial for increasing risk of HIV acquisition, novel approaches are needed to understand how these syndemic problems interrelate. This study examined the associations between nine self-reported syndemic indicators in 194 MSM at high risk of HIV acquisition. We compared exploratory factor analyses (EFA) to a network analysis. In the present study, network analysis consisted of edges representing bidirectional partial polychoric correlations between nodes, which represent psychosocial syndemic indicators. EFA yielded a 1-factor solution including suicidal ideation (SI), injection drug use (IDU), depression, social anxiety, intimate partner violence, substance use, and sexual compulsivity, and excluded heavy drinking and childhood sexual abuse. Network analysis yielded a pattern of interconnectedness with the most central nodes being SI, IDU, substance use, and depression. Statistically significant relationships (absolute edge weights) were found between SI and depression, social anxiety, and IDU, and IDU and substance use. These results suggest that depression and substance use, especially more severe presentations of these conditions such as SI and IDU, are prominent interconnected components of the HIV syndemic among MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition. SI, IDU, substance use, and depression may indeed be prudent targets of intervention. Future research on the inclusion of these syndemic indicators in analytical models involving interaction terms may be warranted.},

  abstract = {Background Scoping studies are an increasingly popular approach to reviewing health research evidence. In 2005, Arksey and O'Malley published the first methodological framework for conducting scoping studies. While this framework provides an excellent foundation for scoping study methodology, further clarifying and enhancing this framework will help support the consistency with which authors undertake and report scoping studies and may encourage researchers and clinicians to engage in this process. Discussion We build upon our experiences conducting three scoping studies using the Arksey and O'Malley methodology to propose recommendations that clarify and enhance each stage of the framework. Recommendations include: clarifying and linking the purpose and research question (stage one); balancing feasibility with breadth and comprehensiveness of the scoping process (stage two); using an iterative team approach to selecting studies (stage three) and extracting data (stage four); incorporating a numerical summary and qualitative thematic analysis, reporting results, and considering the implications of study findings to policy, practice, or research (stage five); and incorporating consultation with stakeholders as a required knowledge translation component of scoping study methodology (stage six). Lastly, we propose additional considerations for scoping study methodology in order to support the advancement, application and relevance of scoping studies in health research. Summary Specific recommendations to clarify and enhance this methodology are outlined for each stage of the Arksey and O'Malley framework. Continued debate and development about scoping study methodology will help to maximize the usefulness and rigor of scoping study findings within healthcare research and practice.},

  abstract = {HIV surveillance systems show that gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a disproportionate burden of HIV in North American and European countries. Within the MSM category, HIV prevalence is often elevated among ethnic minority (i.e., Latino, Asian, and Black) MSM, many of whom are also foreign-born immigrants. Little research has focused specifically on foreign-born populations, though studies that provide data on the nativity of their samples offer an opportunity to investigate the potential role of transnational migration in informing HIV risk among ethnic minority MSM. This systematic review of ethnic minority MSM studies where the nativity of the sample is known provides a robust alternative to single studies measuring individual-level predictors of HIV risk behaviour. In this review, HIV prevalence, unprotected sex, drug use, and HIV testing are analysed in relation to the ethnicity, nativity, and location of the samples included. The results, which include high rates of HIV, unprotected sex, and stimulant use in foreign-born Latino samples and high rates of alcohol and club drug use in majority foreign-born Asian Pacific Islander (API) samples, provide baseline evidence for the theory of migration and HIV risk as syndemics within ethnic minority populations in North American and European countries. The findings also suggest that further research on the contextual factors influencing HIV risk among ethnic minority MSM groups and especially immigrants within these groups is needed. These factors include ethnic networks, individual post-migration transitions, and the gay communities and substance use cultures in specific destination cities. Further comparative work may also reveal how risk pathways differ across ethnic groups. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: Literature in the West suggested that bisexual men have a higher smoking rate compared to gay men. Data on patterns of smoking among gay and bisexual men are limited in Eastern countries like China. This study examined the cigarette smoking prevalence for gay versus bisexual men in China and their unique minority stress - smoking pathways.~Methods: Between September 2017 and November 2018, we surveyed a convenience sample of 538 gay men and 138 bisexual men recruited from local sexual minority organizations in four metropolitan cities in China (i.e., Beijing, Wuhan, Nanchang, and Changsha). Measures included sexual orientation, sociodemographics, theory-based minority stressors, depressive symptoms, and past 30-day cigarette smoking. Two-group (gay men vs. bisexual men) structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test possible distinct mechanisms between theory-based stressors, depressive symptoms, and cigarette smoking among gay men and bisexual men, respectively. Results: The average age of participants was 26.51 (SD = 8.41) years old and 76.3\% of them had at least a college degree. Bisexual men reported a higher rate of cigarette smoking compared to gay men (39.9\% vs. 27.3\%). Two-group SEM indicated that the pathways for cigarette smoking were not different between gay and bisexual men. Higher rejection anticipation was associated with greater depressive symptoms (standardized {$\beta$} = 0.32, p \&lt; .001), and depressive symptoms was not associated with cigarette smoking. Conclusions: Minority stress, specifically rejection anticipation, may be critical considerations in addressing depressive symptoms, but not smoking, among both gay and bisexual men in China.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We intended to verify the syndemic effect of psychosocial health conditions on suicidal ideation among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Shanghai, China; design a comprehensive framework for the identification of the MSM with suicidal ideation; and provide suggestion for suicidality intervention among MSM. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 547 MSM in 4 districts in Shanghai. Sociodemographic, psychosocial, and suicidal ideation information of the participants was collected. Logistic regressions were performed to assess the relationship between psychosocial variables and suicidal ideation and to verify the syndemic effect of psychosocial factors. RESULTS: Of the MSM sample, 10.6\% reported suicidal thoughts in the past year. In univariate analysis, depression, anxiety, loneliness, impulsivity, involuntary subordination (IS), social support, and risky sex were associated with suicidal ideation. Multivariate analysis found that IS (ORm = 2.92, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.55-5.51) and risky sex (ORm = 3.79, 95\% CI = 1.44-9.97) remained significant. The MSM with more than 5 psychosocial health problems were nearly 4 times more likely (adjusted odds ratio = 4.68, 95\% CI = 2.23-9.80) to have had suicidal ideation in the past year. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the syndemic effect of psychosocial health problems in magnifying the risk of suicidality among MSM. More integrated and holistic approaches in the identification of high-risk groups and intervention of suicidality among MSM are needed.},

  abstract = {background Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV and other STIs worldwide. Rectal douching, which is commonly used by MSM in preparation for anal sex, may increase the risk of HIV and other STIs by injuring the rectal mucosa. Results from individual studies reporting associations between rectal douching and HIV and other STIs among MSM are inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the association between rectal douching and HIV and other STIs among MSM. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science for studies published from January 1970 to November 2018. Studies that reported ORs and 95\% CIs of associations between rectal douching and infection with HIV/STIs, or reported enough data to calculate these estimates, were included. We assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. ORs were pooled using a random effects model. results Twenty-eight eligible studies were identified in our review, of which 24 (20 398 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. Rectal douching was associated with increased odds of infection with HIV (OR 2.80, 95\% CI 2.32 to 3.39), and any STI other than HIV (including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and human papillomavirus) (OR 2.46, 95\% CI 1.95 to 3.11) among MSM. For specific STIs, douching was associated with increased odds of viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV) (OR 3.29, 95\% CI 2.79 to 3.87), and chlamydia or gonorrhoea (OR 3.25, 95\% CI 2.02 to 5.23). These associations remained significant in studies that adjusted for potential confounders. Conclusion Rectal douching may put MSM at increased risk for infection with HIV and other STIs. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify this association, and health education materials should inform men of the potential for increased risk of infection with rectal douching.},

We conducted an exploratory study to understand current contraceptive practices and fertility desires among transgender men during and after transitioning. Study design: Self-identified transgender and transmasculine individuals assigned female at birth, ages 18\textendash 45, completed an anonymous online survey derived from standardized family planning surveys. We recruited participants from LGBT health centers, online listservs, and online groups for transgender men and used a mixedmethods analysis to evaluate quantitative and qualitative data. Results: Of the one hundred and ninety-seven participants included in the study, the median age was 30 years old, most respondents were white, and 86\% were taking masculinizing hormones (testosterone). Of the 60 pregnancies reported, 10 (17\%) pregnancies occurred after stopping testosterone, 1 (1.6\%) while taking testosterone irregularly, and 5 of 7 abortions occurred in participants who had been using testosterone in the past. Over half of the respondents desired at least one child, and a quarter reported fears of not getting pregnant. The majority of participants reporting using contraception (n=110, 60.1\%), with condoms and pills used most commonly (n= 90, 49.2\% and n=62, 33.9\% respectively). Methods of contraception used did not differ between testosterone users and non-users, except for hormonal IUDs (20\% testosterone versus 7\% non-testosterone). Thirty participants (16.4\%) believed that testosterone was a form of contraception, and 10 (5.5\%) participants reported that their healthcare providers advised testosterone as contraception. Conclusion: Transgender men use contraception and can experience pregnancy and abortion, even after transitioning socially and hormonally. Transgender men need counseling and care regarding reproductive health, including contraceptive and conception counseling.},

Diagnosis rates and incidence density were calculated for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis C, genital herpes, and genital warts. Incidence density was estimated among repeat testers who converted from a negative to positive test result. We also conducted Poisson regression analysis to determine factors that were associated with increased incidence rates., RESULTS: A total of 47,170 visits were identified for gay/bisexual men during our time frame. The median age was 34 years (interquartile range, 27-43 years), and most clients were seen in Vancouver. Although trends for most STI were stable, diagnoses of gonorrhea and syphilis have risen steadily in recent years. Coinfection with HIV was associated with higher gonorrhea and syphilis rates in the Poisson regression model. In addition, visiting a Vancouver clinic and younger age were associated with increased incidence., CONCLUSIONS: Our clinic-based sentinel surveillance system found increasing trends for gonorrhea and syphilis among gay/bisexual men but not for other STI in British Columbia. Further investigation is required to explore the syndemic effects of syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIV. This new platform will be a valuable tool for ongoing monitoring of STI and targeting prevention efforts.},

Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can be characterized by mild upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection involving non-life threatening pneumonia, and life-threatening pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome. It affects all age groups, including newborns, to the elders. Particularly, pregnant women may be more susceptible to COVID-19 since pregnant women, in general, are vulnerable to respiratory infection. In pregnant women with COVID-19, there is no evidence for vertical transmission of the virus, but an increased prevalence of preterm deliveries.

  abstract = {Background: Suicide is the third-leading cause of death among adolescents and nonsuicidal self-harm occurs in 13\%\textendash{} 45\% of individuals within this age group, making these phenomena major public health concerns. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth particularly are at risk for engaging in these behaviors. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about the specif\i c risk factors associated with suicidal ideation and self-harm behaviors in the population. Purpose: This study provides a longitudinal evaluation of the relative contributions of general and LGBT-specif\i c risk factors as well as protective factors to the occurrence of suicidal ideation and self-harm in an ethnically diverse sample of LGBT youth. Methods: A community sample of 246 LGBT youth (aged 16 \textendash 20 years) was followed prospectively over f\i ve time points at regular 6-month intervals. Participants completed a baseline structured interview assessing suicide attempt history and questionnaires measuring gender nonconformity, impulsivity, and sensation-seeking. At follow-up assessments, participants completed a structured interview assessing self-harm and questionnaires for suicidal ideation, hopelessness, social support, and LGBT victimization. Data were collected from 2007 to 2011, and HLM analyses were conducted in 2011. Results: A history of attempted suicide (pϭ0.05); impulsivity (pϭ0.01); and prospective LGBT victimization (pϭ0.03) and low social support (pϭ0.02) were associated with increased risk for suicidal ideation. Suicide attempt history (pϽ0.01); sensation-seeking (pϭ0.04); female gender (pϽ0.01); childhood gender nonconformity (pϽ0.01); and prospective hopelessness (pϽ0.01) and victimization (pϽ0.01) were associated with greater self-harm. Conclusions: General and LGBT-specif\i c risk factors both uniquely contribute to likelihood of suicidal ideation and self-harm in LGBT youth, which may, in part, account for the higher risk of these phenomena observed in this population.},

  abstract = {The current review presents a meta-analysis of the existing empirical literature on the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals, as well as on correlates of NSSI within sexual and gender minority populations. Eligible publications (n = 51) were identified through a systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Embase, supplemented by a search of references of prior reviews on this topic. NSSI prevalence rates were quite elevated among sexual (29.68\% lifetime) and gender (46.65\% lifetime) minority individuals compared to heterosexual and/or cisgender peers (14.57\% lifetime), with transgender (46.65\% lifetime) and bisexual (41.47\% lifetime) individuals being at greatest risk. Even among these group findings, sexual minority youth emerged as an especially vulnerable population. Moreover, current evidence suggests these rates and differences between LGBT and heterosexual and/or cisgender peers have not declined over time. These findings may in some measure be due to the existence of LGBT-specific risk correlates combined with general risk correlates being more severe among sexual and gender minority populations. Additional research, particularly employing a longitudinal design, is needed in this area to advance efforts to reduce risk for NSSI among sexual and gender minority individuals.},

We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 46 LGBT persons and six key informants (e.g. healthcare providers). Participants described depression, substance use, and HIV as mutually reinforcing and situated in larger social contexts of stigma. Alcohol use was a stigma coping strategy and a way to build LGBT connections. At the same time, alcohol use elevated HIV vulnerabilities by lowering condom use uptake. Pervasive stigma reinforced barriers to healthcare engagement. Community-led support and services were leveraged to navigate stigma, reduce HIV vulnerabilities, and ultimately improve health.

Lesbian, bisexual and queer (LBQ) women experience sexual violence at similar or higher rates than heterosexual women. Most research with LBQ women, however, has focused on measuring prevalence of sexual violence rather than its association with health outcomes, individual, social and structural factors. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with LBQ women in Toronto, Canada. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess correlates of lifetime sexual assault (LSA). Almost half (42\%) of participants (n = 415) reported experiences of LSA. Participants identifying as queer were more likely to have experienced LSA than those identifying as lesbian. When controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, experiencing LSA was associated with higher rates of depression, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), receiving an STI test, belief that healthcare providers were not comfortable with their LBQ sexual orientation, and sexual stigma (overall, perceived and enacted). A history of sexual violence was associated with lower: self-rated health, overall social support, family social support and self-esteem. This research highlights the salience of a social ecological framework to inform interventions for health promotion among LBQ women and to challenge sexual stigma and sexual violence. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Author.},

  abstract = {Introduction Stigma and discrimination contribute to elevated depression risks among sexual minority women (SMW) and gender minority (GM) people who identify as lesbian, bisexual, or queer. Syndemics theory posits that adverse psychosocial outcomes cluster to negatively impact health and mental health outcomes among sexual minorities. We tested whether a syndemic condition composed of low social support, low self-rated health, low self-esteem, and economic insecurity mediated the relationship between sexual stigma and depressive symptoms among SMW/GM. Methods We implemented a cross-sectional, Internet-based survey with SMW and GM in Toronto, Canada. We conducted structural equation modeling using maximum likelihood estimation to test a conceptual model of pathways between sexual stigma, syndemic factors, and depressive symptoms. Results A total of 391 SMW/GM with a mean age of 30.9 (SD = 7.62) were included in the analysis. The model fit for a latent syndemics construct consisting of psychosocial variables (low social support, low self-rated health, low self-esteem, economic insecurity) was very good ({$\chi$}2 = 6.022, df = 2, p =.049; comparative fit index = 0.973, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.918, root-mean square error of approximation = 0.072). In the simultaneous model, sexual stigma had a significant direct effect on depression. When the syndemic variable was added as a mediator, the direct path from sexual stigma to depression was no longer significant, suggesting mediation. The model fit the data well: {$\chi$}2 = 33.50, df = 12, p =.001; comparative fit index = 0.951, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.915, root-mean square error of approximation = 0.068. Conclusions Our results highlight the salience of considering both sexual stigma and syndemic factors to explain mental health disparities experienced by SMW and GM. Addressing sexual stigma in the context of co-occurring psychosocial factors and economic insecurity will be key to achieving optimal health for SMW and GM.},

  title = {Contextual Factors and the Syndemic of Alcohol Use and Risky Sexual Behaviors among Men Who Have Sex with Men.},
  author = {Lopez Castillo, Humberto},
  address = {{US}},
  abstract = {Since the early 1990s with the AIDS pandemic, there has been an increasing interest on the importance of risky sexual behaviors, especially among men who have sex with men (MSM). An important antecedent for these behaviors is alcohol use. Studies consistently show an increased frequency of both alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors in MSM populations. However, to date, there has not been a precise estimate of the effect size in these diverse populations and a consistent way to measure it. More so, the importance of context is often cited as a source of variability, but is rarely measured in these studies. Contextual factors are different and specific for MSM, as they have been approached by two theories, both of which will be guiding this dissertation: Singer's Syndemic Theory and Meyer's Minority Stress Theory. Chapter 1, then presents a comprehensive review of both theories as they apply to alcohol use, risky sexual behaviors, and contextual factors driving them. Chapter 2 answers the first research question about effect sizes through a systematic literature review. The effect sizes or measures of association of these contextual risk and protective factors were summarized using meta-analytic techniques. Using five electronic databases, we identified 26 studies in 26 years (1990--2015), all diverse in terms of sampling techniques, assessment of sexual orientation, operationalization of alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, contextual factors included, and measurement of effect sizes. Despite this diversity, studies reporting an effect size were pooled and summarized using both descriptive and meta-analytic techniques, as appropriate. Meta-analyses were conducted using Cochrane's guidelines for generic inverse variance outcomes with random effects. The pooled effects of alcohol use on condomless anal intercourse (CAI; OR 1.73 [95\% CI 1.43, 2.10], I2 0\%), heavy episodic drinking on CAI (OR 1.88 [95\% CI 1.25, 2.81], I2 32\%), and heavy episodic drinking on condomless oral sex (OR: 8.00; 95\% CI 2.48, 25.81), as well as the effects of substance use, mental health status, violence and victimization, and self-reported HIV status as contextual factors in the pathway between alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors were calculated, reported, and discussed along with study limitations and implications for public health. Chapter 3 answers the second research question regarding a standardized measurement model for effect sizes and the multiple mediation of contextual factors. We used the male subset of Wave IV of the AddHealth dataset to test our hypotheses through structural equation modeling approaches, including measurement analysis with invariance testing, path analysis for direct effects, and multiple mediation analysis through bootstrapping for indirect effects. The AUD scale was invariant between MSM and MSW, but the risky sexual behavior scale was not. For MSM, the standardized direct effect of AUD onto risky sexual behaviors was --1.25 and the standardized total indirect effect of the multiple mediation model was 1.58, 95\% CI [1.42, 1.73]. Among the mediators, the strongest indirect effect for any measured or latent mediator was the mental health construct (2.09). We conclude that even though AUD has the same measurement structure for MSM and MSW, its effect on risky sexual behaviors does not operate the same way for these two populations, supporting both causal and contextual behavioral theories. Conclusions are individually discussed, respectively, in Chapters 2 and 3. However, Chapter 4 puts both manuscript conclusions in context and further discusses future implications for public health research, practice, and policy.

These analyses examine the types, contexts, and sources of lifetime sexual orientation and gender identity victimization (SGV) in a diverse sample of sexual minority men (SMM) and transgender women as well as the extent to which experiences of SGV vary among subgroups of the population. Cross-sectional data were collected as part of a study of sexual health, mental health, and HIV examined through the lens of syndemic production in young SMM. Measures assessed sociodemographic characteristics as well as the types, sources, and contexts of physical assault and verbal harassment due to actual or perceived gender or sexuality. Verbal harassment was more prevalent in the sample than physical assault (44.5\% vs. 11.6\%). Schools or sports teams and neighborhoods were the most common contexts for verbal and physical SGV. Strangers were the most frequent perpetrators of SGV, followed by family and peers. Bivariate analyses showed significant differences in SGV based on race, education, perceived familial SES, sexual identity, and borough of residence. In multivariate analyses, race, SES, sexual identity, and borough of residence were significant predictors of verbal SGV. Findings suggest that SGV experiences are not uniform in sexual minority young adults, and thus prevention and care must be targeted. Understanding the multiple identities of sexual minority young adults who experience greater levels of victimization can allow for policy and interventions to best support those at risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Public Significance Statement-The perpetration of physical and verbal victimization on sexual minority young adults creates psychosocial conditions that compromise the well-being of individuals and the entire population.

  abstract = {Background Suicide is a leading cause of death among men who have sex with men (MSM) and suicidal ideation may put individuals at higher risk of suicide. A great disparity of lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM was observed across studies, indicating the importance of a reliable estimation of the pooled lifetime prevalence. However, the only one published meta-analysis estimating the pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM was conducted in 2008 with only 2 eligible studies. Subsequently, there was a rapid increase of publications about lifetime suicidal ideation among MSM, suggesting that an update on the pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM was necessary. Therefore, this study aimed to update the estimation of the pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM. Methods Electronic databases of PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus (social science), Embase and PsycInfo were searched until September 2017 to identify relevant studies. Cross-sectional studies exploring the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM were enrolled. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran Q test and quantified using the I 2 statistic. The possibility of publication bias was assessed using both Begg's rank test and Egger's linear test, and an Egger's funnel plot for asymmetry was presented. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the geographic area, sample source and HIV status. Results Nineteen studies with a total of 26,667 MSM were included, of which 9374 were identified with suicidal ideation. A high degree of heterogeneity (P\,{$\leq$}\,0.001, I 2 =99.2\%) was observed among the eligible studies, with the reported prevalence ranging from 13.18 to 55.80\%. The pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM by a random effects model was 34.97\% (95\% confidence interval: 28.35\%\textendash 41.90\%). Both the Begg's rank test and Egger's linear test indicated low possibility of publication bias. Subgroup analyses showed that the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM differed significantly by geographic area, sample source and HIV status (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Conclusions The high pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM found in this meta-analysis significantly underscores the importance of early assessment of suicidal ideation among MSM, as well as the need for strengthening the psychological interventions.

Syndemic theorists explain the clustering of these disparities among adult MSM as a result of cultural marginalization. To date, research on a similar emerging syndemic among young MSM has been limited to quantitative studies. This study seeks to better understand these disparities, and how they may cluster together, via qualitative interviews with 21 ethnically diverse, HIV infected young MSM aged 18-24 years old. These youth report a lack of gay-specific HIV prevention education, absence of role models, and lack of productive future goal-related activities as factors related to their acquisition of HIV, and downplay substance use as a factor. Although not necessarily the components traditionally cited by syndemic theorists, these findings support the notion that multiple factors of cultural marginalization cluster together in the lives of young MSM, and underscore the importance of community-level interventions, such as sexual health education, access to mentors, and assistance with future goal setting and planning.},

We conducted a total of 106 interviews (four repeat interviews every six months) with a cohort of 30 participants. Some reported condomless sex and no discussion about condom use or HIV status with sexual partners. Fifteen participants reported that they were living with HIV. Methamphetamine use contributed to participants' unstable housing, job loss, destructive relationships and HIV risk. One third of participants reported a history of intimate partner violence. About half had a history of incarceration resulting from intimate partner violence, substance use/dealing and/or other activities. Post-release, having a criminal record limited job opportunities and impacted financial stability. Consequently, some men engaged in survival work involving HIV risk (sex work, organising/participating in sex parties). Methamphetamine use, intimate partner violence and incarceration may constitute syndemic conditions that increase young Black men who have sex with men's risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. HIV prevention interventions must address syndemics and include structural factors and the wider social environment.},

  abstract = {Background. Complicated and persistent grief reactions afflict approximately 10\% of bereaved individuals and are associated with severe disruptions of functioning. These maladaptive patterns were defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) as persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), but its criteria remain debated. The condition has been studied using network analysis, showing potential for an improved understanding of PCBD. However, previous studies were limited to self-report and primarily originated from a single archival dataset. To overcome these limitations, we collected structured clinical interview data from a community sample of newly conjugally bereaved individuals (N = 305). Methods. Gaussian graphical models (GGM) were estimated from PCBD symptoms diagnosed at 3, 14, and 25 months after the loss. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) was generated from initial PCBD symptoms, and comorbidity networks with DSM-5 symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were analyzed 1 year post-loss. Results. In the GGM, symptoms from the social/identity PCBD symptoms cluster (i.e. role confusion, meaninglessness, and loneliness) tended to be central in the network at all assessments. In the DAG, yearning activated a cascade of PCBD symptoms, suggesting how symptoms lead into psychopathological configurations. In the comorbidity networks, PCBD and depressive symptoms formed separate communities, while PTSD symptoms divided in heterogeneous clusters. Conclusions. The network approach offered insights regarding the core symptoms of PCBD and the role of persistent yearnings. Findings are discussed regarding both clinical and theoretical implications that will serve as a step toward a more integrated understanding of PCBD.},

  abstract = {Background: Improved access to both maternal antiretroviral therapy and infant prophylaxis may have an impact on the performance of virological assays for diagnosis of HIV infection in infants. This systematic review was performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of virological testing at birth as well as the performance of virological testing on dried blood spots at 6 weeks among HIV- and antiretroviral (ARV)-exposed infants. Methods: A systematic review was performed for studies published between January 1, 2009 and January 30, 2015. The search strategy included studies related to HIV, nucleic acid amplification tests, and newborns/infants and queried PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS as well as several conference proceedings. Two independent reviewers collected studies and extracted data. The final analysis includes summary estimates of the sensitivities and specificities of the virological assays assessed. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies was used to evaluate the risk of bias in the studies. Results: A total of 2243 records were screened with a final selection of 5 manuscripts. To assess the test characteristics of virological testing at birth, 2 studies were used to calculate a pooled sensitivity of 69.3\% (95\% confidence interval: 61.1 to 77.4) and a specificity of 99.9\% (98.6-100\%). The quality of evidence to support the sensitivity of assays at birth was low, whereas the quality of evidence for the specificity of such tests was intermediate-high. In terms of the performance of virological testing on dried blood spots for HIV- and ARV-exposed infants, 3 studies were used to calculate a pooled sensitivity of 99.4\% (98.3-100.00\%) and specificity of 99.6\% (99.1-100.00\%). The quality of evidence for both outcomes was low. Conclusion: The performance of polymerase chain reaction at birth demonstrates low sensitivity and high specificity, reflecting the difficulty of detecting intrapartum infections at birth and transmission dynamics. In addition, there is no evidence to suggest poor performance of virological testing on dried blood spots for ARV-exposed infants. Overall, given the very limited and low-quality evidence, further research is needed to assess the accuracy of polymerase chain reaction at different time points and in the context of more effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission interventions.},

Methods: Separate meta-analyses were conducted to examine suicidality and depression disparities. Studies were included if the average age of the participants was {$<$}18 years, and if suicidality or depression symptoms were compared across SMY and heterosexual youth. Results: SMY reported significantly higher rates of suicidality (odds ratio [OR] = 2.92) and depression symptoms (standardized mean difference, d =.33) as compared with the heterosexual youth. Disparities increased with the increase in the severity of suicidality (ideation [OR = 1.96], intent/plans [OR = 2.20], suicide attempts [OR = 3.18], suicide attempts requiring medical attention [OR = 4.17]). Effects did not vary across gender, recruitment source, and sexual orientation definition. Conclusions: Disparities in suicidality and depression may be influenced by negative experiences including discrimination and victimization. Clinicians should assess sexual orientation, analyze psychosocial histories to identify associated risk factors, and promote prevention and intervention opportunities for SMY and their families. ?? 2011 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.},

With the aim of systematically reviewing the available literature in this field, this study identifies 31 papers that explore the rates of NSSI and suicidality in trans people. From reviewing the literature, it was revealed that trans people have a higher prevalence of NSSI and suicidality compared to the cisgender (non-trans) population. There appear to be some gender differences within these rates, with trans men at a greater risk for NSSI behaviour. Prevalence rates differ depending on the different stages of transition, but they are still overall greater than the cisgender population. The study concludes that trans individuals are at a greater risk of NSSI behaviour and suicidality than the cisgender population, and discusses risk factors and the need to develop effective preventative interventions.},

Several conditions have been attributed to the high HIV incidence and prevalence within this group, including experiences of discrimination, unemployment, incarceration, stigma, and elevated rates of sexual risk and substance use. In response to these needs, the Gay and Lesbian Latino AIDS Education Initiative and Prevention Point Philadelphia, two local community-based organizations in Philadelphia, developed the Transhealth Information Project (TIP). TIP is a peer-led six-session hybrid individual- and group-based intervention emphasizing leadership, social and structural interventions, and HIV risk reduction that incorporates other evidence-based practices for HIV prevention and care. Since 2003, TIP has served over 1,500 ITE and linked them to HIV prevention and care services. TIP has an established record of reaching ITE and linking them to HIV prevention services and HIV primary care. TIP's utilization speaks to the need for interventions to respond to the complex, interacting syndemic factors that cumulatively determine HIV vulnerability among ITE.

  abstract = {Alcohol consumption is a significant public health concern among Latino men and Latina transgender women who have sex with men. However, characteristics and behaviors associated with alcohol consumption in this population, particularly in regard to the complex influence of syndemic factors, remain understudied. The purpose of this study was to examine predictors of high-risk alcohol consumption (i.e. binge or heavy drinking). Between January and March of 2014, 176 Latino men and Latina transgender women in New York City completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire. We developed a syndemics scale to reflect the total number of syndemic factors - clinically significant depression, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and discrimination - reported by each participant. We also carried out a multinomial logistic regression model predicting binge and heavy drinking. Forty-seven percent of participants reported high-risk alcohol consumption in the past 30 days (21\% binge and 26\% heavy). Approximately 16\% of participants reported no syndemic factors, 27\% reported one factor, 39\% reported two factors, and 18\% reported three or four. In the multinomial logistic regression model, our syndemic factors scale was not significantly associated with binge drinking. However, participants who reported three or four factors were significantly more likely to report heavy drinking. In addition, having multiple sexual partners was associated with an increased risk of binge and heavy drinking; involvement in a same-sex relationship was associated with binge drinking. Further work is needed to develop effective prevention intervention approaches for high-risk alcohol consumption within this population.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Syndemic theory has been proposed as a framework for understanding the role of multiple risk factors driving the HIV epidemic among sexual and gender minority individuals. As yet, the framework has been relatively absent in research on Latinos/as. METHODS: We used logistic regression to assess relationships among cumulative syndemic conditions - including clinically significant depression, high-risk alcohol consumption, discrimination, and childhood sexual abuse - engagement with multiple partners and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) in a sample of 176 Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, an increase in the number of syndemic factors experienced was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting multiple partners and CAI. In multivariable analyses, participants with 2, 3, and 4 factors were significantly more likely to report multiple partners than those with 0 (aOR=4.66, 95\% CI [1.29, 16.85); aOR=7.28, 95\% CI [1.94, 27.28] and aOR=8.25, 95\% CI [1.74, 39.24] respectively; p{$<$}0.05. Regarding CAI, only participants with 3 and 4 factors differed from those with 0 aOR=7.35, 95\% CI [1.64, 32.83] and OR=8.06, 95\% CI [1.39, 46.73] respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive approaches that address syndemic factors, and capitalize on resiliency, are needed to address the sexual health needs of Latino MSM.},

Identifying the role of multiple syndemic factors associated with sexual risk behaviors is imperative in order to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. Cross-sectional data for this study were derived from three cycles of the Philadelphia portion of the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System. This study explored the impact of syndemic factors - heavy drinking, exchange sex, and homophobic discrimination - on sexual HIV risk behaviors, operationalized as number of male partners, and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with main and casual partners among Latinx MSM (n=464). Analyses took two forms: a syndemic approach, using the cumulative number of conditions as an independent variable; and a non-syndemic approach, incorporating each condition as a unique factor. In multivariable syndemic analyses, participants with two or more factors reported more male partners and more CAI casual male partners than those with none. In non-syndemic models, homophobic discrimination and exchange sex were significantly positively associated with total number of male partners, while heavy drinking was associated with more casual CAI partners. Quantitative results indicate that syndemic and non-syndemic approaches vary in their relative capacity to account for sexual risk among Latinx MSM.},

  abstract = {Background: `Chemsex' is the use of drugs before or during planned sexual events to facilitate, enhance, prolong and sustain the experience. Drugs associated with chemsex are methamphetamine, GHB/GBL, mephedrone, cocaine and ketamine. This review syntheses published research on the antecedents, behaviours and consequences associated with chemsex behaviours among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: Papers from high income countries which were published between January 2000 and September 2018 reporting the use of chemsex drugs before or during sex were identified through Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL and Central. Results were synthesised using a narrative approach and conceptualised using a behavioural analysis framework. Results: The search identified 2492 publications, of which 38 were included in the final synthesis. There were wide variations in chemsex prevalence estimates due to the heterogeneous sampling in the studies. Chemsex participants have expectations that the drugs will positively affect their sexual encounters and HIV positive MSM are more likely to engage in the behaviour than HIV negative MSM. There were wide ranging prevalence estimates on injecting drugs for sexual purposes and the sharing of injecting equipment with some evidence of unsafe injecting practices. Participants were more likely to engage in condomless anal intercourse than men who do not engage in chemsex. This may increase the risk of transmission for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Conclusion: A minority of MSM appear to engage in chemsex behaviours but they are at risk of this negatively impacting on their health and well-being. Further research is required to examine high risk chemsex behaviours, impact of chemsex on psycho-social well-being and if chemsex influences uptake of PrEP, PEP and sexual health screening.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the percentage and the profile of women with known HIV-1 seropositivity who do not receive the prepartum phase of preventive treatment for maternofetal transmission. METHODS: An observational study was conducted as part of the French Perinatal Cohort, an ongoing nationwide cohort of HIV-infected women and their children (followed from birth). This analysis was restricted to women who were delivered between 1996 and 1999. RESULTS: Among the 2167 women studied, 92 (4.3\%) did not receive the prepartum phase of preventive treatment. This proportion fell below 10\% in 1996 and subsequently stabilized at 3\% to 4\%. The reasons for nontreatment were the woman's refusal (34\%), premature delivery (8\%, before initiation of planned treatment), late diagnosis of maternal HIV infection (3\%, at the time of delivery), or unmonitored pregnancy (54\%). One third of the women in this latter category were aware of their seropositivity before becoming pregnant. Treated and untreated women did not differ in terms of the usual parameters of HIV infection, geographic origin (sub-Saharan Africa vs. Europe), or HIV transmission category (sexual vs. intravenous [IV] drug use). Untreated women were also less likely than treated women to receive other preventive measures such as intrapartum IV zidovudine infusion, treatment of the newborn, and formula feeding. Indirect evidence strongly suggested that the untreated women were socially marginalized. CONCLUSIONS: The prepartum phase of preventive treatment for maternofetal transmission is well accepted by HIV-seropositive women in France. The proportion of women who do not receive this treatment could be further reduced by earlier screening (before or at the beginning of pregnancy) and by focusing on a small subgroup of socially marginalized women.},

However, factors other than hrHPV are likely to be involved and further study of cofactors is required because of the possibility of syndemic interactions. Methods Three hundred and fourteen patients underwent 457 operations. Histopathology and hrHPV testing using the Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC 2) method were performed. Demographic factors and sexually transmissible infections (STIs) were recorded. Results Results showed that hrHPV alone was associated with HSIL (OR = 4.65, p {$<$} 0.001). None of the other STIs were alone associated with HSIL but amplification of risk was found when hrHPV infection occurred with HIV (OR = 11.1); syphilis (OR = 5.58); HSV 2 (OR = 7.85); gonorrhoea (OR = 6.45) and some other infections. Conclusions These results suggest that hrHPV is a sufficient cause of anal HSIL. Seropositivity for HIV, HSV 2, T. pallidum, HBV and HCV and a history of gonorrhoea or chlamydia exert a powerful amplifying factor increasing the risk of HSIL above the risk with hrHPV alone. Other co-factors which are associated with an increased risk of HSIL are increased age, male gender, MSM behaviour and self-reported history of more than 50 sexual partners. This pattern of disease in patients with warts is characteristic of a syndemic with potential serious increased risk of anal carcinoma.},

This comorbidity is associated with poorer self-management, worse disease outcomes, and higher mortality. Syndemic theory is a novel social epidemiological framework that emphasizes the role of economic and social adversity in promoting disease comorbidity and health disparities. Informed by the syndemic framework, this study explored associations of socioeconomic and psychosocial adversity (low income/education, trauma history, adverse childhood experiences, ethnic discrimination, neighborhood problems [e.g., violence]) with comorbidity of diabetes and depression symptoms in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) and Sociocultural Ancillary Study. Participants were 5,247 Latino adults, aged 18\textendash 74, enrolled in four U.S. cities from 2008 to 2011. Participants completed a baseline physical exam and measures of depression symptoms and psychosocial adversity. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine associations of adversity variables with comorbid diabetes and high depression symptoms. Household income below \$30,000/year was associated with higher odds of diabetes/depression comorbidity (odds ratio [OR] = 4.61; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.89, 7.33) compared to having neither condition, as was each standard deviation increase in adverse childhood experiences (OR = 1.41; 95\% CI: 1.16, 1.71), ethnic discrimination (OR = 1.23; 95\% CI: 1.01, 1.50), and neighborhood problems (OR = 1.53; 95\% CI: 1.30, 1.80). Low household income, adverse childhood experiences, ethnic discrimination, and neighborhood problems are related to comorbid diabetes and depression in U.S. Latinos. Future studies should explore these relationships longitudinally.},

  abstract = {Globally, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) experience an increased burden of poor sexual, mental and physical health. Syndemics theory provides a framework to understand comorbidities and health among marginalised populations. Syndemics theory attempts to account for the social, environmental, and other structural contexts that are driving and/or sustaining simultaneous multiple negative health outcomes, but has been widely critiqued. In this paper, we conceptualise a new framework to counter syndemics by assessing the key theoretical mechanisms by which pathogenic social context variables relate to ill-health. Subsequently, we examine how salutogenic, assets-based approaches to health improvement could function among GBMSM across diverse national contexts. Comparative quantitative secondary analysis of data on syndemics and community assets are presented from two international, online, cross-sectional surveys of GBMSM (SMMASH2 in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and Sex Now in Canada). Negative sexual, mental and physical health outcomes were clustered as hypothesised, providing evidence of the syndemic. We found that syndemic ill-health was associated with social isolation and the experience of stigma and discrimination, but this varied across national contexts. Moreover, while some of our measures of community assets appeared to have a protective effect on syndemic ill-health, others did not. These results present an important step forward in our understanding of syndemic ill-health and provide new insights into how to intervene to reduce it. They point to a theoretical mechanism through which salutogenic approaches to health improvement could function and provide new strategies for working with communities to understand the proposed processes of change that are required. To move forward, we suggest conceptualising syndemics within a complex adaptive systems model, which enables consideration of the development, sustainment and resilience to syndemics both within individuals and at the population-level.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that young people can experience disadvantage due to their sexual orientation, such as homophobic bullying, mental health issues, rejection from family and friends and increased risk of homelessness. The extent and impact of this disadvantage has not been systematically captured to date and constitutes a major evidence gap. Equally, the Equality Act 2010 has established a new Single Public Sector Equality Duty to promote equality, and provide protection for people of all ages from discrimination because of their sexual orientation. A rst step in understanding how to capture such inequality is to review the evidence and explore the issues involved in researching and monitoring sexual orientation in adolescence \textendash{} the focus of this paper. Evidence suggests that by the age of 12 young people are dealing with emerging sexual feelings and attraction to others. Through the teenage years, some young people do begin to identify their sexual orientation, and others do not, or are just unsure. Young people also begin to identify the actual/perceived sexual orientation of others and this underpins homophobic bullying. Existing studies suggest that it is practically and ethically possible to capture evidence on sexual orientation in adolescence through research and monitoring, in order to better understand disadvantage. The questions we ask must take into account that young people's sexual orientation is not xed and is in a process of forming. Equally, the type of question asked, and method used, should be appropriate for the purpose of the study. If the focus is sexual health risks, then sexual behaviour may be the most useful measure. If, however, the intention is to gauge experiences of discrimination then sexual identity may be a more accurate dimension to measure. It is important to identify the role of sexual orientation as a predictor of health, social and economic outcomes. The failure to account for sexual orientation effects may lead to inaccurate scienti c and policy conclusions, for example about targeting health or education interventions for young people. Most importantly, the principles at work here are about ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all young people, whatever their sexual orientation.},

We aimed to investigate the social determinants of this mental health inequality. Methods A two-stage sequential mixed method study was conducted. Firstly, 29 semi-structured interviews with LGBT youth (aged 13\textendash 25 years old) were completed. Data was analysed thematically. Stage 2 involved a self-completed questionnaire employing an online community-based sampling strategy (n = 789). Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict suicidality. Results Five social determinants explained suicidal risk: (i) homophobia, biphobia or transphobia; (ii) sexual and gender norms; (iii) managing sexual and gender identities across multiple life domains; (iv) being unable to talk; (v) other life crises. Youth who were transgender (OR = 1.50, P {$<$} 0.022), disabled (OR = 2.23, P {$<$} 0.000), had self-harmed (OR = 7.45, P {$<$} 0.000), were affected by abuse (OR = 2.14, P {$<$} 0.000), and affected by not talking about their emotions (OR = 2.43, P {$<$} 0.044) were most likely to have planned or attempted suicide. Conclusions Public health universal interventions that tackle bullying and discrimination in schools, and selected interventions that provide specific LGBT youth mental health support could reduce LGBT mental health inequalities in youth suicidality.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Intramuscular (IM) testosterone is the most common modality for testosterone therapy of both male hypogonadism and female-to-male (FTM) gender transition. However, IM injections can be painful and often are not self-administered by the patient. The objective of this study was to further characterize subcutaneous (SC) administration of testosterone as an effective and safe alternative to IM injections by evaluating the pharmacodynamics of serum total and free testosterone concentrations between weekly testosterone injections. Methods: Eleven FTM transgender patients already receiving weekly SC testosterone cypionate with documented therapeutic levels prior to enrollment had free and total serum testosterone levels measured at eight different time points during a 1-week dosing interval. Results: Mean levels of total and free testosterone were stable and remained well within the normal range between injections. Overall mean 6 standard deviation levels for the seven samples taken between injections were 627 6 206 ng/dL (range, 205 to 1410) for total testosterone and 146 6 51 pg/mL (range, 38 to 348) for free testosterone. No adverse effects were encountered. Conclusions: The results of this study support use of SC testosterone to achieve therapeutic and stable serum testosterone levels for the purpose of gender transition. It is anticipated that these results can be extended to hypogonadal men. This route may be preferred over IM testosterone because it is relatively painless and easy to self-inject thus allowing for the convenience and economy of patient selfadministration.},

  abstract = {The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on HBV, HCV, and HIV co-infections and triple infection. We characterized co-occurrence of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections at the population level in British Columbia (BC) to identify patterns of predisposing factors unique to co-infection subgroups. METHODS: We analyzed data from the BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort, which includes all individuals tested for HCV or HIV in BC between 1992 and 2013, or included in provincial public health registries of HIV, HCV, HBV, and active tuberculosis. Individuals were classified as negative, mono-, and co-infection groups based on HIV, HBV, and HCV status. We evaluated associations between risk factors (injection drug use, sexual orientation etc.) and co-infection groups using multivariate multinomial logistic regression. FINDINGS: Of a total of 1,376,989 individuals included in the analysis, 1,276,290 were negative and 100,699 were positive for HIV, HBV, and/or HCV. Most cases (91,399, 90.8\%) were mono-infected, while 3991 (4.0\%) had HBV/HCV, 670 HBV/HIV (0.7\%), 3459 HCV/HIV (3.4\%), and 1180 HBV/HCV/HIV (1.2\%) co-infection. Risk factor and demographic distribution varied across co-infection categories. MSM classification was associated with higher odds of all HIV co-infection groups, particularly HBV/HIV (OR 6.8; 95\% CI: 5.6, 8.27), while injection drug use was most strongly associated with triple infection (OR 64.19; 95\% CI: 55.11, 74.77) and HIV/HCV (OR 23.23; 95\% CI: 21.32, 25.31). INTERPRETATION: Syndemics of substance use, sexual practices, mental illness, socioeconomic marginalization, and co-infections differ among population groups, highlighting avenues for optimal composition and context for health services to meet each population's unique needs.

Yet a radically different approach to conceptualizing psychopathology promises to advance our understanding, thereby complementing traditional laboratory experiments. In contrast to viewing symptoms as reflective of underlying, latent categories or dimensions, network analysis conceptualizes symptoms as constitutive of mental disorders, not reflective of them. Disorders emerge from the causal interactions among symptoms themselves, and intervening on central symptoms in disorder networks promises to foster rapid recovery. One purpose of this article is to contrast network analysis with traditional approaches, and consider its strengths and limitations. A second purpose is to review novel computational methods that may enable researchers to discern the causal structure of disorders (e.g., Bayesian networks).

Objective: In this study, we extended this work by estimating the structure of relations among PTSD symptoms in adults reporting personal histories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA; N = 179). Method: We employed two complementary methods. First, using the graphical LASSO, we computed a sparse, regularized partial correlation network revealing associations (edges) between pairs of PTSD symptoms (nodes). Next, using a Bayesian approach, we computed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to estimate a directed, potentially causal model of the relations among symptoms. Results: For the first network, we found that physiological reactivity to reminders of trauma, dreams about the trauma, and lost of interest in previously enjoyed activities were highly central nodes. However, stability analyses suggest that these findings were unstable across subsets of our sample. The DAG suggests that becoming physiologically reactive and upset in response to reminders of the trauma may be key drivers of other symptoms in adult survivors of CSA. Conclusions: Our study illustrates the strengths and limitations of these network analytic approaches to PTSD.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Ticagrelor reversibly inhibits the platelet adenosine diphos-phate P2Y 12 receptor (P2Y 12). 1 It is approved for prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic cardio-vascular disease and shows evidence of superior clinical performance compared with other P2Y 12 inhibitors. A post hoc analysis of the Comparison of Ticagrelor (AZD6140) and Clopidogrel in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome (PLATO) trial 2 revealed that patients treated with ticagrelor had a lower risk of infection-related death than those treated with clopidogrel bisulfate. 3 More recently, in the Targeting Platelet-Leukocyte Aggregates in Pneumonia With Ticagre-lor (XANTHIPPE) study, ticagrelor was associated with improved lung function in patients hospitalized for pneumonia. 4 We therefore questioned whether ticagrelor or its metabo-lites could possess antimicrobial properties. Methods | Tic agrelor and its major metabolites (M5 AR-C133913, M7, M8 AR-C124910) 5 were synthetized and tested in time-kill assays against gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A (MRSE) (ATCC 35984); methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (ATCC 25904, ATCC 6538); glycopeptide intermediate S aureus (GISA) Mu-50 (ATCC 700699); methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) (ATCC BAA-1556); Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212); vancomycin-resistant E faecalis (VRE) (ATCC BAA-2365); and Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 12386) and against gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAK laboratory strain). Biofilm formation was assessed in vitro with crystal violet staining and in a mouse model of S aureus polyurethane-implant infection using Xen-29 bacteria (Perkin Elmer). Infected disks were implanted in specific pathogen-free BALB/cAnCrl mice (Charles River). The mouse protocol was approved by the ethical committee of Li\`ege University. Results | Ticagrelor and AR-C124910 had bactericidal activity against all gram-positive strains tested, including drug-resistant strains GISA, MRSE, MRSA, and VRE. The minimal bactericidal concentration was 20 {$\mu$}g/mL against MSSA, GISA, MRSA, and VRE; 30 {$\mu$}g/mL against MRSE; and 40 {$\mu$}g/mL against E faecalis and S agalactiae. Although a dosage of 5 {$\mu$}g/mL delayed growth of MRSA, ticagrelor was ineffective against gram-negative strains in concentrations up to 80 {$\mu$}g/mL. At minimal bactericidal concentration, ticagrelor was superior to vancomycin (Figure 1A), with rapid killing of late-exponential-phase cultures of MRSA (time to kill 99.9\% of the initial inoculum, 2 hours). Bactericidal activity was similar to the bactericidal cyclic lipopeptide daptomycin, recently introduced against resistant strains of S aureus (Figure 1A). A subminimal bactericidal concentration of ticagrelor (10 {$\mu$}g/mL) combined with vancomycin (4 {$\mu$}g/mL) killed approximately 50\% of the initial MRSA inoculum, depicting synergistic activity. Ticagrelor also increased the bactericidal activity of rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and vanco-mycin in a disk diffusion assay. It displayed bactericidal activity against MRSE and VRE (Figure 1B and C), with superiority over vancomycin for killing MRSE. At 24 hours, its ability to kill MRSE and VRE was similar to daptomycin (Figure 1B and C). Ticagrelor inhibited MRSA, MRSE, and VRE biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1D-F); biofilm mass was reduced by more than 85\% after exposure to 20 {$\mu$}g/mL ticagrelor. Finally, in mice, conventional oral antiplatelet dosages of ticagrelor (3 mg/kg loading dose, then 1.5 mg/kg twice daily) inhibited biofilm growth on S aureus-preinfected implants and dissemination of bacteria to surrounding tissues (Figure 2). Discussion | We describe bactericidal activity of ticagrelor against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria that pose a threat to human health. Although bactericidal concentrations are not reached systemically in patients receiving typical dosages for treating cardiovascular disease (ticagrelor C max = 1.2 {$\mu$}g/mL after one 180-mg loading dose and 0.75 {$\mu$}g/mL at 90 mg twice daily steady state), antibacterial activity at infection sites may still be achieved through local, possibly platelet-driven, drug accumulation. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the reduced infection-related death with ticagrelor seen in the PLATO trial 3 and could also explain improvement in lung function in patients with pneumonia who took ticagrelor in the XANTHIPPE study. 4 These findings warrant further investigations, including design of randomized clinical trials comparing the protective activity of ticagrelor against gram-positive bacterial infection in patients with cardiovascular disease with other antiplatelet drugs. We are unaware of similar findings with other P2Y 12 inhibitors, and we did not observe in vitro antibacterial activity of the active metabolite of prasugrel in concentrations up to 100 {$\mu$}g/mL. Ticagrelor might prove superior to other P2Y 12 inhibitors in patients with cardiovas-cular disease at risk for gram-positive bacterial infections such as infective endocarditis. 6 We did not isolate mutants resistant to ticagrelor, and serial passaging of MSSA or MRSA in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of ticagrelor jamacardiology.com (Reprinted) JAMA Cardiology},

This article will discuss general approaches to the sexual and reproductive health care of transgender and gender-expansive youth, and review the topics of contraception and menstrual suppression, fertility preservation and family building, and the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and HIV in this population. Although transgender youth on testosterone therapy often become amenorrheic, ovulation and pregnancy can still occur, and thus all youth on testosterone therapy should be counseled on the potential for pregnancy and have access to effective contraception. Many forms of hormonal contraceptives are both safe and efficacious when used by youth on testosterone therapy. Hormonal contraceptives may also be used to provide menstrual suppression for those experiencing dysphoria from unwanted uterine bleeding. All transgender youth should receive counseling on fertility preservation and reproductive options prior to starting pubertal blockers and/or gender-affirming hormones, therapies that have varying effects on long-term fertility potential. Several different methods of fertility preservation exist, however there are numerous barriers to transgender youth receiving fertility preservation services, and rates of utilization of these services is low. Transgender individuals suffer from a disproportionate burden of HIV compared to their peers\textemdash thought to result from stigma, marginalization, and lack of access to appropriate care. All providers caring for youth should be informed about HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which may help to prevent HIV acquisition.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sexual risk, substance use, and mental ill health constitute a syndemic of co-occurring, mutually reinforcing epidemics amongst men who have sex with men (MSM). Developed since 1995, e-health interventions offer accessible, anonymous support and can be effective in addressing these outcomes, suggesting the potential value of developing e-health interventions that address these simultaneously amongst MSM. We conducted a systematic review of e-health interventions addressing one or more of these outcomes amongst MSM and in this paper describe the theories of change underpinning relevant interventions, what these offer and how they might complement each other., METHODS: We identified eligible reports via expert requests, reference-checking and database and Google searches. Results were screened for reports published in 1995 or later; focused on MSM; reporting on e-health interventions providing ongoing support to prevent HIV/STIs, sexual risk behaviour, substance use, anxiety or depression; and describing intervention theories of change. Reviewers assessed report quality, extracted intervention and theory of change data, and developed a novel method of synthesis using diagrammatic representations of theories of change., RESULTS: Thirty-three reports on 22 intervention theories of change were included, largely of low/medium-quality. Inductively grouping these theories according to their core constructs, we identified three distinct groupings of theorised pathways. In the largest, the 'cognitive/skills' grouping, interventions provide information and activities which are theorised to influence behaviour via motivation/intention and self-efficacy/perceived control. In the 'self-monitoring' grouping, interventions are theorised to trigger reflection, self-reward/critique and self-regulation. In the 'cognitive therapy' grouping, the theory of change is rooted in cognitive therapy techniques, aiming to reframe negative emotions to improve mental health., CONCLUSIONS: The synthesised theories of change provide a framework for developing e-health interventions that might holistically address syndemic health problems amongst MSM. Improving reporting on theories of change in primary studies of e-health interventions would enable a better understanding of how they are intended to work and the evidence supporting this. The novel diagrammatic method of theory of change synthesis used here could be used for future reviews where interventions are driven by existing well-defined behaviour and behaviour change theories., SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42018110317.},

Yet, there is little research elucidating pathways that predict health or that promote resiliency among sexual minorities. Building on the minority stress model, the present study utilized relational cultural theory to situate sexual minority health within a relational framework. Specifically, the study tested mediators of the relationships between distal (i.e., discrimination, rejection, victimization) and proximal stressors (i.e., internalized homophobia, sexual orientation concealment) and psychological and physical distress for sexual minorities. Among 719 sexual minority adults, structural equation modeling analyses were used to test 4 models reflecting the mediating effects of shame, poorer relationships with a close peer and the lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender (LGBT) community, and loneliness on the associations between minority stressors and psychological distress (i.e., depression and anxiety) and physical distress (i.e., distressing physical symptoms). As hypothesized, the associations between distal and proximal minority stressors and distress were mediated by shame, poorer relationships with a close peer and the LGBT community, and loneliness. Findings underscore the possible relational and interpersonal mechanisms by which sexual minority stressors lead to psychological and physical distress.},

However, there is little research examining the negative effects of bisexual-specific minority stressors on bisexual individuals' mental health as well as psychological factors that might help explain minority stressors' deleterious effects. This research examined the effects of distal minority stressors (i.e., anti-bisexual experiences from both heterosexual as well as lesbian and gay people) and proximal stressors (i.e., internalized heterosexism and sexual orientation concealment) on psychological distress and suicidality among bisexual adults (N = 503). Building on the relational framing of the minority stress model, we also tested one relational factor (i.e., loneliness) as a mediator of the associations between distal and proximal minority stressors and poor mental health (i.e., psychological distress and suicidality). Structural equation modeling analyses were used to test the mediating effects of loneliness on the associations between minority stressors and psychological distress and suicidality. Although distal and proximal minority stressors were not associated with each other, loneliness mediated the effects of distal and proximal minority stressors on psychological distress and suicidality. The results of this study underscore the importance of targeting bisexual-specific minority stressors as well as loneliness in preventive interventions to improve the mental health of bisexual individuals.},

Design/methods: Cohort study of medical files of n\,=\,155 male-to-female (transwomen) and n\,=\,233 female-to-male transgender persons (transmen) of an Endocrine outpatient clinic between 2009 and 2017. Results: Median time to reach amenorrhoea in transmen under testosterone monotherapy was 3 months, regardless of whether testosterone undecanoat or gel was used. Transmen with higher levels of hemoglobin 3\textendash 4 months after onset of GAHT had a greater chance to reach amenorrhea early, whereas testosterone levels showed no significant correlation (hemoglobin: HR: 1.639; 95\% CI: 1.036\textendash 2.591, P\,=\,0.035; testosterone: HR: 0.999; 95\% CI: 0.998\textendash 1.001, P\,=\,0.490).

Liver values and blood lipids showed an alignment to reference range of the required sex in both groups. Relevant elevations of liver values were rare (2.44\% in transmen, 4.23\% in transwomen) and transient in most cases. Most relevant side effects were acne (44.8\%), respectively erythrocytosis (up to 5.6\%) in transmen and venous thrombembolism (1.9\%) in transwomen.

  abstract = {Background: The need for systematic methods for reviewing evidence is continuously increasing. Evidence mapping is one emerging method. There are no authoritative recommendations for what constitutes an evidence map or what methods should be used, and anecdotal evidence suggests heterogeneity in both. Our objectives are to identify published evidence maps and to compare and contrast the presented definitions of evidence mapping, the domains used to classify data in evidence maps, and the form the evidence map takes. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of publications that presented results with a process termed "evidence mapping" or included a figure called an "evidence map." We identified publications from searches of ten databases through 8/21/2015, reference mining, and consulting topic experts. We abstracted the research question, the unit of analysis, the search methods and search period covered, and the country of origin. Data were narratively synthesized. Results: Thirty-nine publications met inclusion criteria. Published evidence maps varied in their definition and the form of the evidence map. Of the 31 definitions provided, 67\% described the purpose as identification of gaps and 58\% referenced a stakeholder engagement process or user-friendly product. All evidence maps explicitly used a systematic approach to evidence synthesis. Twenty-six publications referred to a figure or table explicitly called an "evidence map," eight referred to an online database as the evidence map, and five stated they used a mapping methodology but did not present a visual depiction of the evidence. Conclusions: The principal conclusion of our evaluation of studies that call themselves "evidence maps" is that the implied definition of what constitutes an evidence map is a systematic search of a broad field to identify gaps in knowledge and/or future research needs that presents results in a user-friendly format, often a visual figure or graph, or a searchable database. Foundational work is needed to better standardize the methods and products of an evidence map so that researchers and policymakers will know what to expect of this new type of evidence review. Systematic review registration: Although an a priori protocol was developed, no registration was completed; this review did not fit the PROSPERO format.},

  abstract = {Lactose intolerance refers to the clinical syndrome in which symptoms of bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea arise following the consumption of lactose-containing foods. Lactose malabsorption results from congenital lactase deficiency, secondary lactose intolerance, and, most commonly, from acquired primary lactase deficiency, a highly prevalent condition affecting 65\% to 74\% of the worldwide population, with wide regional and ethnic variations.1,2 Symptoms arising from lactose malabsorption result from fluid shifts into the intestinal lumen driven by an osmotic gradient and subsequent fermentation of lactose by bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract. In this article we review the development of clinical lactose intolerance, diagnostic testing, and treatment of individuals presenting with symptoms of lactose intolerance. Lactose is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose linked via {$\beta$}-1,4 glycosidic bond that cannot be absorbed via transporters across the small bowel epithelium. Lactase is an intestinal brush border enzyme expressed on the intestinal villous tips, arising from the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase gene and capable of hydrolyzing the {$\beta$}-glycosidic bond in lactose. Lactase activity in humans is highest immediately before weaning and expression subsequently declines to 5\% to 10\% of infant levels in adulthood. Interestingly, the term ``lactase deficiency'' has become established in the literature even though low lactase activity is the normal adult human and mammalian condition. While low levels of lactase expression occur in the majority of the worldwide adult population, secondary lactose intolerance can also result from a number of gastrointestinal conditions resulting in damage to the absorptive surface of the small bowel, including celiac disease, Crohn disease, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, intestinal infections, and radiation/chemotherapy enteritis. Congenital lactase deficiency is a separate, rare autosomal recessive condition resulting from alterations in the coding region of the lactase gene and presenting as diarrhea within days of birth.},

We reviewed the available literature regarding the urological impact of ketamine abuse and its management. Twenty-two publications were found in total after a search of all databases including Pubmed, Medline and Google Scholar using the words `ketamine', `bladder' and `cystitis' with no limits imposed. There are approximately 110 cases reported in the literature in the form of case series, case reports and letters. The effect of ketamine abuse on the bladder is universally similar; however, there is no uniform method adopted in reporting the symptoms, diagnosis and management. Very little is known regarding the pathogenesis of its effects on the urinary tract. Patients with severe irritative LUTS, a positive history of ketamine abuse and the absence of any other aetiology should be considered to have ketamine-induced vesicopathy. Effort must be made to elicit the history of drug abuse in those with no found cause of LUTS, especially in the young. Presently, ketamine cessation is the only effective treatment modality to prevent deterioration of the renal function and indeed offer the possibility of symptom resolution. Management akin to that formulated for interstitial cystitis patients would appear to offer the greatest opportunity for effective treatment.},

Although screening for Chlamydia trachomatis is widely recommended among young adult women, little information is available regarding the prevalence of chlamydial and gonococcal infections in the general young adult population. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of chlamydial and gonococcal infections in a nationally representative sample of young adults living in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional analyses of a prospective cohort study of a nationally representative sample of 14,322 young adults aged 18 to 26 years. In-home interviews were conducted across the United States for Wave III of The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) from April 2, 2001, to May 9, 2002. This study sample represented 66.3\% of the original 18,924 participants in Wave I of Add Health. First-void urine specimens using ligase chain reaction assay were available for 12,548 (87.6\%) of the Wave III participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalences of chlamydial and gonococcal infections in the general young adult population, and by age, self-reported race/ethnicity, and geographic region of current residence. RESULTS Overall prevalence of chlamydial infection was 4.19\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.48\%-4.90\%). Women (4.74\%; 95\% CI, 3.93\%-5.71\%) were more likely to be infected than men (3.67\%; 95\% CI, 2.93\%-4.58\%; prevalence ratio, 1.29; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.63). The prevalence of chlamydial infection was highest among black women (13.95\%; 95\% CI, 11.25\%-17.18\%) and black men (11.12\%; 95\% CI, 8.51\%-14.42\%); lowest prevalences were among Asian men (1.14\%; 95\% CI, 0.40\%-3.21\%), white men (1.38\%; 95\% CI, 0.93\%-2.03\%), and white women (2.52\%; 95\% CI, 1.90\%-3.34\%). Prevalence of chlamydial infection was highest in the south (5.39\%; 95\% CI, 4.24\%-6.83\%) and lowest in the northeast (2.39\%; 95\% CI, 1.56\%-3.65\%). Overall prevalence of gonorrhea was 0.43\% (95\% CI, 0.29\%-0.63\%). Among black men and women, the prevalence was 2.13\% (95\% CI, 1.46\%-3.10\%) and among white young adults, 0.10\% (95\% CI, 0.03\%-0.27\%). Prevalence of coinfection with both chlamydial and gonococcal infections was 0.030\% (95\% CI, 0.18\%-0.49\%). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of chlamydial infection is high among young adults in the United States. Substantial racial/ethnic disparities are present in the prevalence of both chlamydial and gonococcal infections.},

In this review, we discuss the proposed mechanisms of MTCT, evidence for cell-free and cell-associated transmission in different routes of MTCT, and the impact of ARVs on virus levels and transmission. Many population-based studies support a role for cell-associated virus in transmission and in vitro studies also provide some support for this mode of transmission. However, animal model studies provide proof-of-principle that cell-free virus can establish infection in infants, and studies of ARVs in HIV-infected pregnant women show a strong correlation with reduction in cell-free virus levels and protection. ARV treatment in MTCT potentially provides opportunities to better define the infectious form of virus, but these studies will require better tools to measure the infectious cell reservoir.},

  abstract = {The HIV epidemic in Latin America is highly concentrated in men who have sex with men (MSM). In the United States, multiple co-occurring psychosocial conditions have been shown to act as intertwined epidemics to potentiate HIV transmission among MSM. To date, no study has examined the role of syndemics and condomless sex among MSM in Latin America. In 2012, an online survey was conducted among members of the largest social/sexual networking website for MSM in Latin America. Participants were asked about demographics, sexual behaviors, HIV/STI diagnoses, and psychosocial well-being, including depression, suicidal ideation, hazardous alcohol use, hard drug use during sex, history of childhood/adolescent sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and sexual compulsivity. Multivariable logistic generalized estimation equations were used to assess the relationship of syndemic factors and (1) engagement in higher risk condomless anal sex and (2) self-report of prior HIV diagnosis. Among 24,274 survey respondents, 74.6~\% of the sample had at least one syndemic factor. In an additive model, syndemics were associated with increased odds of higher risk condomless anal sex, ranging from adjusted odds ratio of 1.31 (95~\% CI 1.20, 1.43) for one syndemic factor to 4.06 (95~\% CI 3.25, 5.09) for 6/7 syndemic factors. Similarly, syndemics were associated with increased odds of HIV infection (p~{$<~$}.0001). This study provides initial evidence that intertwined syndemics increase HIV risk behavior and HIV infection among MSM in Latin America. In the Latin American context, comprehensive HIV prevention interventions for MSM should be developed and tested that simultaneously address co-occurring psychosocial conditions and HIV risk.},

Background: Cross-sectional studies have suggested that co-occurring epidemics or "syndemics" of psychosocial health problems may accelerate HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. We aimed to assess how 5 syndemic conditions (depressive symptoms, heavy alcohol use, stimulant use, polydrug use, and childhood sexual abuse) affected HIV incidence and sexual risk behavior over time. Methods: Eligible men in a large prospective cohort of sexually active HIV-uninfected MSM completed HIV testing and behavioral surveys at baseline and every 6 months for 48 months. We examined interrelationships between psychosocial problems and whether these interactions increased the odds of HIV risk behaviors and risk of seroconversion over study follow-up. Results: Among 4295 men, prevalence of psychosocial conditions was substantial at baseline and was positively associated with each other. We identified a statistically significant positive dose-response relationship between numbers of syndemic conditions and HIV seroconversion for all comparisons (with the greatest hazard among those with 4-5 conditions, adjusted hazard ratio 8.69; 95\% confidence interval: 4.78 to 15.44). The number of syndemic conditions also predicted increased HIV-related risk behaviors over time, which mediated the syndemic-HIV seroconversion association. Conclusions: The accumulation of syndemic psychosocial problems predicted HIV-related sexual risk behaviors and seroconversion in a large sample of US MSM. Given the high prevalence of syndemic conditions among MSM and the moderate effect sizes attained by traditional brief behavioral interventions to date, the HIV prevention agenda requires a shift toward improved assessment of psychosocial comorbidities and stronger integration with mental health and substance abuse treatment services.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Worldwide, young transgender women (YTW) contend with exceptionally high risks of HIV infection. Cross-sectional studies have suggested that co-occurring epidemics or "syndemics" of psychosocial problems may accelerate HIV acquisition and transmission through elevated sexual risk behavior among transgender women. We aimed to examine how a syndemic of 7 psychosocial problems potentiates HIV sexual risk behavior among a multicity, longitudinal cohort of sexually active YTW in the United States. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 233 YTW from Boston, MA, and Chicago, IL, completed behavioral surveys at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months. We used generalized estimating equations to examine the prospective relationship of overlapping psychosocial problems and HIV sexual risk behavior (ie, condomless anal or vaginal sex) among YTW. RESULTS: The prevalence of 7 psychosocial syndemic problems was substantial at baseline and remained high at each time point: 6.4\% reported polydrug use in the past 4 months (excluding stimulants); 7.7\% reported heavy alcohol use in the past 4 months; 10\% reported a history of childhood sexual abuse; 15.9\% reported stimulant use in the past 4 months; 41.7\% reported experiencing lifetime intimate partner violence; 42.1\% reported clinically significant depressive symptoms; and 68.6\% reported lifetime transgender-specific victimization. We identified a statistically significant positive "dose-response" relationship between the number of psychosocial syndemic problems and condomless anal or vaginal sex over time. CONCLUSIONS: The accumulation of "syndemic" psychosocial problems predicted HIV sexual risk behavior in a prospective cohort of YTW. Given the high prevalence of psychosocial problems and HIV sexual risk behavior, as well as having the highest HIV incidence among any risk group, the HIV prevention agenda requires a shift toward improved assessment of psychosocial comorbidities and stronger integration with gender-affirming and supportive mental health, violence recovery, and addiction treatment services for this population.},

Data were collected as part of the Teen Health and Technology online survey of 5,907 13 to 18 year-old Internet users in the United States. Past year sexual harassment was reported by 23-72\% of youth, depending upon sexual orientation, with the highest rates reported by lesbian/queer girls (72\%), bisexual girls (66\%), and gay/queer boys (66\%). When examined by gender identity, transgender youth reported the highest rates of sexual harassment - 81\%. Overall, the most common modes for sexual harassment were in-person followed by online. Distress in the form of interference with school, family, and/or friends; creating a hostile environment; or being very/extremely upset was reported by about half of the sexually harassed bisexual girls and lesbian/queer girls, 65\% of the gender non-conforming/other gender youth, and 63\% of the transgender youth. Youth with high social support and self-esteem were less likely to report sexual harassment. Findings point to the great importance of sexual harassment prevention for all adolescents, with particular emphasis on the unique needs and experiences of youth of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Socio-emotional programs that emphasize self-esteem building could be particularly beneficial for reducing the likelihood of victimization and lessen the impact when it occurs. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

More than 40\% of respondents experienced both homophobia and racism in the past 12 months. Los Angeles participants, those with lower income, and those who reported being HIV-positive were more likely to report experiencing both types of social discrimination.

  abstract = {Background: The prevalence of and the risk for sexually transmissible infections (STIs) for women engaging in same-sex sexual behaviour was investigated among women attending an STI clinic. Methods: Data from electronic medical records were reviewed and logistic regression used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of STIs. Women reporting life-time exclusively female partners (WSW) and women reporting female and male partners (WSWM) were compared with women reporting exclusively male partners (WSM). Outcomes included: Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Neisseria gonorrhoea, HIV and syphilis. Results: The study population comprised 103 564 women (WSW 641, WSWM 12 010 and WSM 90 913). Overall prevalence of STIs was 8\%. Crude OR of STIs for WSW: 0.56 (95\% CI 0.39\textendash 0.81), for WSWM: 0.99 (95\% CI 0.92\textendash 1.06) compared with WSM. Multivariate analysis revealed an interaction effect between same-sex sexual behaviour and smoking. Among non-smokers; WSW adjusted OR was 0.41 (95\% CI 0.21\textendash 0.80), WSWM adjusted OR was 0.91 (95\% CI 0.81\textendash 1.02) compared with WSM. Among smokers; WSW adjusted OR was 1.03 (95\% CI 0.63\textendash 1.67) for WSWM adjusted OR was 1.00 (CI 95\% 0.93\textendash 1.13), compared with WSM. Conclusion: This study, including the largest cohort of women reporting life-time exclusively female partners in an STI study, shows that WSW generally are at lower risk for acquiring STIs than WSM. Smoking WSW, however, had the same risk for acquiring bacterial STIs as WSM and WSWM. Our study suggests that all WSW should receive the same encouragement to test for STIs as WSM.},

It takes an innovative approach by focusing on the way in which bisexuality is addressed in this body of literature. The article reveals the marginalisation, under-representation and invisibility of bisexuality within and across the social sciences in relation to both bisexual experience and identity. Reasons for this varied across the different eras, including the heterosexist nature of the literature, the impact of gay and lesbian-focused identity politics, and queer deconstructionism. In addition, patterns of bisexual erasure and invisibility were uneven, with some scholarship taking inclusive approaches or criticising prejudice against bisexuality. The initial findings of the review were enriched by critical commentary from key relevant sociologists and political scientists. The article concludes that future sexualities scholarship could be enhanced by greater consideration of bisexuality.},

A convenience sample of 2,220 nonheterosexual (1,459 lesbian/gay, 413 bisexual, 168 queer, 146 pansexual, and 34 other ``write-in'') individuals were recruited for a cross-sectional online survey. In support of our hypotheses, those adopting pansexual identities were younger than those adopting lesbian, gay, and bisexual identities, and those adopting queer and pansexual identities were more likely to be noncisgender than cisgender, and more likely to be cisgender women than men. The majority of pansexual individuals demonstrated sexual orientation indices within the bisexual range, and showed equivalent patterns of sexual attraction, romantic attraction, sexual behavior, and partner gender as bisexual-identified men and women. In contrast, three-quarters of queer men, and more than half of queer women, reported sexual attraction in the homosexual range. This study found that rather than a general movement toward nontraditional sexual identities, queer and pansexual identities appear most appealing to nonheterosexual women and noncisgender individuals. These findings contribute important information regarding who adopts queer and pansexual identities in contemporary sexual minority populations.},

This cross-sectional study examines the correlates of HCV and HIV monoinfection and HIV/HCV coinfection in an urban Northeast setting. METHODS: Utilizing an electronic database from a mobile medical clinic in New Haven, CT from January 2003 to July 2011, 8,311 individuals underwent structured health assessment and screening for HIV and HCV. RESULTS: HIV [N{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}601 (8.0\%)] and HCV [N{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}753 (10.1\%)] infection were identified, and 197 (26.1\%) of the 753 with HCV were coinfected with HIV. Both monoinfection and coinfection status were independently correlated with crack cocaine use and increasing age. HIV/HCV coinfection was correlated with men having sex with men (MSM) (AOR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}38.53, p{$<$}0.0080), shooting gallery use (AOR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3.06, p{$<$}0.0070), and not completing high school (AOR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2.51, p{$<$}0.0370). HCV monoinfection correlated with health insurance (AOR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2.16, p{$<$}0.0020), domestic violence (AOR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.99, p{$<$}0.0070), and being Hispanic (AOR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2.63, p{$<$}0.0001), while HIV monoinfection correlated with having had syphilis (AOR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2.66, p{$<$}0.0001) and being Black (AOR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.73, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.0010). CONCLUSIONS: Though HIV and HCV share common transmission risk behaviors, independent correlates with viral infection status in an urban Northeast setting are distinct and have important implications for surveillance, healthcare delivery, disease prevention, and clinical care.},

Freud borrowed the word from physical medicine, where it was used to describe tissue damage, and applied it, for the first time, as a metaphor to a psychological process by which the protective functioning of the mind can too be pierced and wounded by events. The chemsex environment hosts a myriad of potentially traumatising scenarios and experiences, though perhaps disguised as exhilaration or excitement. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is a practitioner's experience. Findings: These experiences piled on top of childhood experiences of being ``less than'' for being gay, can be responsible for widespread undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among those who engage in chemsex. This paper explores this possibility and offers solutions. Originality/value: Compounded trauma and PTSD symptoms amongst MSM who engage in chemsex has to date, not been researched.},

We therefore sought to determine the prevalence of syndemic health problems in a cohort of Ontario nPEP patients, and explored the relationship between syndemic burden and HIV risk. Methods Between 07/2013-08/2016, we distributed a self-administered questionnaire to patients presenting to three clinics in Toronto and Ottawa seeking nPEP for sexual HIV exposures. We used validated screening tools to estimate the prevalence of depression (CES-D score {$\geq$}16), harmful alcohol use (AUDIT {$\geq$}8), problematic drug use (DUDIT {$\geq$}6 men/{$\geq$}2 women), and sexual compulsivity (SCS {$\geq$}24) among men who have sex with men (MSM) respondents. In exploratory analyses, we examined the relationships between syndemic conditions using univariable logistic regression models, and the relationship between syndemic count (total number of syndemic conditions per participant) and HIV risk, as estimated by the HIRI-MSM score, using linear regression models. Results The 186 MSM included in the analysis had median age 31 (IQR = 26\textendash 36), including 87.6\% having a college/undergraduate degree or higher. Overall, 53.8\% screened positive for depression, 34.4\% for harmful alcohol use, 30.1\% for problematic drug use, and 16.1\% for sexual compulsivity. Most participants (74.2\%) had at least one syndemic condition and 46.8\% had more than one. Exploratory analyses suggested positive associations between depression and harmful alcohol use (OR = 2.11, 95\%CI = 1.13, 3.94) and between harmful alcohol use and problematic drug use (OR = 1.22, 95\%CI = 0.65, 2.29). Syndemic count was associated with increased HIRI-MSM risk scores in univariable (2.2, 95\%CI = 1.0, 3.3 per syndemic condition) and multivariable (2.1, 95\%CI = 0.6, 3.6) linear regression models. Conclusions The prevalence of syndemic conditions in MSM seeking nPEP for sexual exposure is alarmingly high, and is associated with underlying HIV risk. Routine screening for these conditions may identify opportunities for intervention and could alleviate future vulnerability to HIV.},

  abstract = {Testosterone therapy is a cornerstone of medical treatment for transgender men who choose to undergo it. The goal of testosterone therapy is usually to achieve serum testosterone concentrations in the male reference range. Testosterone has several desired effects as well as undesired and unknown effects. The desired effects include increased facial and body hair, increased lean mass and strength, decreased fat mass, deepening of the voice, increased sexual desire, cessation of menstruation, clitoral enlargement, and reductions in gender dysphoria, perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. Achievement of these goals comes with potential undesired effects and risks including acne, alopecia, reduced HDL cholesterol, increased triglycerides, and a possible increase in systolic blood pressure. An additional benefit of testosterone therapy (with or without mastectomy) is a reduced risk of breast cancer. Most of the effects of testosterone start to develop within several months of starting therapy, although facial hair and alopecia continue to develop after 1 year. A major limitation in the study of testosterone therapy for transgender men is a paucity of high-quality data due to a shortage of randomised controlled trials (partly because of ethical issues), few prospective and long-term studies, the use of suboptimum control groups, loss to follow-up, and difficulties in recruitment of representative samples of transgender populations.},

Our aim was to investigate the timing and degree of voice deepening over 12 months among an ethnically diverse sample of transgender men. This was a prospective 12-month study at an academic outpatient endocrinology clinic and speech and voice center. The participants were seven transgender men na\"ive to testosterone therapy. All patients received two voice assessments at baseline and one assessment at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months while on intramuscular testosterone esters. Serum testosterone and estradiol concentrations were measured at baseline and every 3 months. All seven transgender men reached a cisgender male mean fundamental frequency (MF0) within 6 months of testosterone therapy and four continued to experience a decrease after 6 months. The mean decrease in MF0 after 12 months of testosterone therapy was 6.4 semitones (49 Hz). Several patterns emerged regarding the extent and timing. For example, some participants showed no decrease in MF0 within the first 3 months of testosterone therapy, whereas others showed their greatest decrease in MF0. We concluded that transgender men who start testosterone therapy display different patterns of voice lowering. Clinicians should counsel transgender men that they may or may not experience voice lowering within the first 3 months of testosterone therapy and that the majority of voice deepening will occur within 6-9 months.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW To explore the medical and surgical clinical dilemmas in the management of trans (transgender) men, a growing population receiving more attention than in the past. RECENT FINDINGS Testosterone therapy is commonly prescribed to trans men for masculinization. Nonetheless, the optimal formulations and doses of testosterone therapy for trans men have not been well established. Testosterone therapy has been associated with increased levels of hemoglobin and triglycerides, as well as diabetes. Periodic monitoring of hemoglobin, cholesterol, and fasting glucose is therefore recommended. As compared to non-transgender women, trans men have lower age-specific rates of breast cancer and cervical cancer which can be attributed, in part, to surgeries such as bilateral mastectomies and hysterectomies. The frequency in which to recommend mammograms and Pap smears (in patients with intact cervices) is uncertain in this population because of a lack of evidence-based data. Many trans men desire and undergo bilateral mastectomies with much fewer undergoing metoidioplasty or phalloplasty. SUMMARY For trans men, most clinicians target serum testosterone concentrations in the normal male reference range. The frequency of screening for breast and cervical cancer should be individualized based upon anatomy, patient age, age of initiation of testosterone therapy, and other factors.},

The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with\textemdash and perished from\textemdash for more than five thousand years.The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out ``war against cancer.'' The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave may have cut off her diseased breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee's own leukemia patient, Carla, The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive\textemdash and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease. Riveting, urgent, and surprising, The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer.},

We emphasize the need to address the broad health and wellbeing issues and needs of LGBT people, rather than exclusively using an illness-based focus such as HIV/AIDS. We critically examine the limitations of population health, the social determinants of health (SDOH), and public health goals, in light of the lack of recognition of gender and sexually diverse individuals and communities. By first acknowledging the unique health and social care needs of LGBT people, then employing anti-oppressive, critical and intersectional analyses we offer recommendations for how to make population health perspectives, public health goals, and the design of public health promotion policy more inclusive of gender and sexual diversity. In health promotion research and practice, representation matters. It matters which populations are being targeted for health promotion interventions and for what purposes, and it matters which populations are being overlooked. In Canada, current health promotion policy is informed by population health and social determinants of health (SDOH) perspectives, as demonstrated by Public Health Goals for Canada. With Canada's multicultural makeup comes the challenge of ensuring that diverse populations are equitably and effectively recognized in public health and health promotion policy.},

  abstract = {Objective: Experiencing depression symptoms, even at mild to moderate levels, is associated with maladaptive outcomes for adolescents. We used network analysis to evaluate which symptoms (and associations between symptoms) are most central to adolescent depression. Method: Participants were part of a large, diverse community sample (N = 1,409) of adolescents between the ages of 13-19 years old. Network analysis was used to identify the most central symptoms (nodes) and associations between symptoms (edges) assessed by the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). We also evaluated these centrality indicators for network robustness using stability and accuracy tests, associated symptom centrality with mean levels of symptoms, and examined potential differences between the structure and connectivity of depression networks in boys and girls. Results: The most central symptoms in the network were self-hatred, loneliness, sadness, and pessimism. The strongest associations between symptoms were sadness-crying, anhedonia-school dislike, sadness-loneliness, school work difficulty-school performance decrement, self-hatrednegative body image, sleep disturbance-fatigue, and self-deprecation-self-blame. The network was robust to stability and accuracy tests. Notably, symptom centrality and mean levels of symptoms were not associated. Boys and girls' networks did not differ in levels of connectivity, though the link between body image and self-hatred was stronger in girls than boys. Conclusions: Self-hatred, loneliness, sadness, and pessimism were the most central symptoms in adolescent depression networks, suggesting these symptoms (and associations between symptoms) should be prioritized in theoretical models of adolescent depression and could also serve as important treatment targets for adolescent depression interventions.},

We aimed to study the characteristics of patients with IE and OAIs, and the interactions between these two infections. METHODS An observational study (1993-2014) which includes two cohorts: (1) patients with IE (n = 607) and (2) patients with bacteremic OAIs (n = 458; septic arthritis of peripheral and axial skeleton, and vertebral and peripheral osteomyelitis). These two cohorts were prospectively collected, and we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and microbiological variables. RESULTS There were 70 cases of IE with concomitant OAIs, representing 11.5\% of IE cases and 15\% of bacteremic OAI cases. Among cases with IE, the associated OAIs mainly involved the axial skeleton (n = 54, 77\%): 43 were vertebral osteomyelitis (61\%), mainly caused by "less virulent" bacteria (viridans and bovis streptococci, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci), and 15 were septic arthritis of the axial skeleton (21\%), which were mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. OAIs with involvement of the axial skeleton were associated with IE (adjusted OR = 2.2; 95\% CI 1.1-4.3) independently of age, sex, and microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with IE, the associated OAIs mainly involve the axial skeleton. Transesophageal echocardiography should be carefully considered in patients presenting with these bacteremic OAIs.},

PURPOSE: We assessed the extent to which these psychosocial health problems had an additive effect on increasing HIV risk among YMSM. METHODS: An urban sample of 310 ethnically diverse YMSM reported on psychosocial health problems, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV status. A count of psychosocial health problems was calculated to test the additive relationship to HIV risk. RESULTS: The prevalence of psychosocial health problems varied from 23\% for regular binge drinking to 34\% for experiencing partner violence. Rates of sexual risk behaviors were high and 14\% of YMSM reported receiving a HIV+ test result. Psychosocial health problems cooccurred, as evidenced by significant bivariate odds ratios (ORs) between 12 of the 15 associations tested. Number of psychosocial health problems significantly increased the odds of having multiple anal sex partners (OR=1.24), unprotected anal sex (OR=1.42), and an HIV-positive status (OR 1.42), after controlling for demographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the existence of cooccurring epidemics, or "syndemic," of health problems among YMSM. Disparities exist not only in the prevalence of HIV among YMSM but also in research to combat the epidemic within this vulnerable population. Future research is needed to identify risk and resiliency factors across the range of health disparities and develop interventions that address this syndemic.},

A structured psychiatric interview assessed clinical depression and conduct disorder symptoms, as well as past and prospective suicide attempts over a 1-year follow-up period (91 \% retention). Participants completed questionnaires measuring general risk factors for suicide attempts, including hopelessness, impulsiveness, and perceived social support. They also completed measures of LGBT-specific suicide risk factors, including gender nonconformity, age of first same-sex attraction, and LGBT victimization. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to examine the relations between predictors and suicide attempt, and to identify mediators. Of nine variables examined, seven were related to lifetime history of attempted suicide: hopelessness, depression symptoms, conduct disorder symptoms, impulsivity, victimization, age of first same-sex attraction, and low family support. Depressive symptoms and hopelessness mediated the relation between multiple risk and resilience factors and suicide attempts. Suicide attempt history was the strongest predictor of prospective suicide attempts. Participants who previously attempted suicide (31.6 \% of the sample) had more than 10 times greater odds of making another attempt in the 1-year follow-up period than were those who had made no previous attempt. These results highlight the need for suicide prevention programs for LGBT youth and suggest the importance of addressing depression and hopelessness as proximal determinants and family support and victimization, which have more distal effects.},

We examined hypothesized drivers of syndemic production and effects on suicide attempts. Methods. Using a pooled data set of 2005 and 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 11 jurisdictions, we used structural equation modeling to model a latent syndemic factor of depression symptoms, substance use, risky sex, and intimate partner violence. Multigroup models examined relations between victimization and bullying experiences, syndemic health issues, and serious suicide attempts. Results. We found experiences of victimization to increase syndemic burden among all male youths, especially MSMW and MSM compared with MSW (variance explained = 44\%, 38\%, and 10\%, respectively). The syndemic factor was shown to increase the odds of reporting a serious suicide attempt, particularly for MSM (odds ratio [OR] = 5.75; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36, 24.39; P {$>$} .001) and MSMW (OR = 5.08; 95\% CI = 2.14, 12.28; P {$>$} .001) compared with MSW (OR = 3.47; 95\% CI = 2.50, 4.83; P {$>$} .001).

The purpose of this study was to use structural equation modeling to understand the structure of the syndemic and to test its longitudinal association with condomless anal sex. Data are from a longitudinal study of 450 YMSM. A primary syndemic component comprised of substance use, violence, and internalizing mental health factors significantly predicted the number of condomless anal sex partners in the full sample. Analyses exploring associations by race/ethnicity found a significant association among White YMSM, but not among Black or Latino YMSM. Higher-order factor modeling suggests these psychosocial factors form a syndemic in all racial/ethnic groups, but the syndemic, as conceptualized here, may be less relevant to racial/ethnic minority YMSM.},

  abstract = {Transgender individuals sometimes report a lack of physical change during hormone treatment, such as alterations in muscle tone or fat distribution. Identifying characteristics of this subgroup could be a step toward individualizing hormone therapy in transgender individuals. Therefore, we study the variation of changes in body composition and characteristics associated with a lack of change. Body composition measures were recorded in 323 transmen and 288 transwomen at every visit from the start of hormone therapy to a maximum of 24 months follow-up. Absence of change was defined as transmen with a decrease in lean body mass or transwomen with a decrease in fat percentage. A lack of change at 24 months was observed in 19 of 94 (20.2\%) transmen and in 9 of 96 (9.4\%) transwomen. The risk of not achieving change in body composition was related to lower testosterone levels and less suppression of LH in transmen (OR: 0.67, 95\% CI: 0.48\textendash 0.94 per SD increase in testosterone and OR: 1.36, 95\% CI: 1.01\textendash 1.83 per SD increase in LH). There is a large variation in body composition changes during hormone therapy, with a substantial proportion of individuals with no measurable effects. In transmen, serum testosterone and LH were associated with a lack of change, but serum hormone levels were not associated with body composition changes in transwomen. The results provide a rationale for individualizing hormone therapy in transmen, by considering individual effects rather than solely relying on a standardized dosage of hormone therapy.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis of proportions is observational and non-comparative in nature. Rarely have we seen a study or tutorial demonstrate how a meta-analysis of proportions should be performed using the R programming language. This tutorial intends to fill this gap. The tutorial consists of two major components: (1) a comprehensive, critical review of the process of conducting a meta-analysis of proportions, in which a number of common practices that possibly lead to biased estimates and misleading inferences are highlighted (e.g., not taking study size and within-group estimates of between-study variance into consideration when calculating mean proportions in the presence of subgroups), and (2) a step-by-step guide to conducting the analysis using R. The process is described in six stages: (1) setting up the R environment and getting a sense of the data being analyzed; (2) calculating effect sizes; (3) identifying and quantifying heterogeneity; (4) constructing forest plots; (5) explaining heterogeneity with moderator analysis; and (6) assessing publication bias. In the last section (assessing publication bias), we argued that funnel plot analyses developed for investigating publication bias in randomized controlled trials may not be suitable for use with meta-analyses of proportions. Three computational options are incorporated in the code for users to choose from to transform proportional data. The presentation of the tutorial is conceptually oriented, the use of formulas is kept to a minimum, and a published meta-analysis of proportions is used as an example to illustrate how to implement the R code and interpret the results of the analysis. Generic R code is provided for readers to use for their analyses. A video tutorial is also provided to facilitate learning (watch the video at wangnaike.com). There are several good reasons for a reader to use this tutorial: (1) one does not need to purchase expensive statistical software like Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) to perform this particular type of meta-analysis, because our code yields exactly the same results as those CMA delivers; (2) our code yields more accurate estimates for mean proportions in the presence of subgroups compared to the code other meta-analysis authors have used; (3) our code allows readers to convert proportional data using three transformation methods (no transformation, the logit, and the double-arcsine transformation), whereas CMA only performs the logit transformation; (4) this tutorial will help readers understand why publication bias (due to non-significant results) is not pertinent in the context of meta-analysis of proportions.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Transmission through breastfeeding remains important for mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) in resource-limited settings. We quantify the relationship between cell-free (RNA) and cell-associated (DNA) shedding of HIV-1 virus in breastmilk and the risk of postnatal HIV-1 transmission in the first 6 months postpartum.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six HIV-positive mothers who transmitted HIV-1 by breastfeeding were matched to 36 non-transmitting HIV-1 infected mothers in a case-control study nested in a cohort of HIV-infected women. RNA and DNA were quantified in the same breastmilk sample taken at 6 weeks and 6 months. Cox regression analysis assessed the association between cell-free and cell-associated virus levels and risk of postnatal HIV-1 transmission.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: There were higher median levels of cell-free than cell-associated HIV-1 virus (per ml) in breastmilk at 6 weeks and 6 months. Multivariably, adjusting for antenatal CD4 count and maternal plasma viral load, at 6 weeks, each 10-fold increase in cell-free or cell-associated levels (per ml) was significantly associated with HIV-1 transmission but stronger for cell-associated than cell-free levels [2.47 (95\% CI 1.33-4.59) vs. aHR 1.52 (95\% CI, 1.17-1.96), respectively]. At 6 months, cell-free and cell-associated levels (per ml) in breastmilk remained significantly associated with HIV-1 transmission but was stronger for cell-free than cell-associated levels [aHR 2.53 (95\% CI 1.64-3.92) vs. 1.73 (95\% CI 0.94-3.19), respectively].\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that cell-associated virus level (per ml) is more important for early postpartum HIV-1 transmission (at 6 weeks) than cell-free virus. As cell-associated virus levels have been consistently detected in breastmilk despite antiretroviral therapy, this highlights a potential challenge for resource-limited settings to achieve the UNAIDS goal for 2015 of eliminating vertical transmission. More studies would further knowledge on mechanisms of HIV-1 transmission and help develop more effective drugs during lactation.},

The epidemic is not evenly distributed across MSM, and young racial minority MSM experience the highest rate of new infections. Race-based sexual stereotyping is not uncommon among MSM, and it may contribute to the isolation of racial minority sexual networks, which has been found to contribute to increased HIV incidence in Black MSM. The goals of these analyses were to describe the race-based sexual preferences and stereotypes of racially diverse young MSM (YMSM), and to examine whether endorsement of sexual stereotypes was associated with sexual risk behavior when having sex with partners of the stereotyped race. Data were taken from Crew 450, an ongoing longitudinal study of a syndemic of psychosocial health issues linked to HIV among YMSM in Chicago and surrounding areas. Analyses utilized data from three study waves, and longitudinal analyses were conducted with Hierarchical Linear Modeling. YMSM generally endorsed same-race preferences for sexual partners. Black partners were rated highest in displaying stereotypically dominant characteristics and in likelihood of taking the top/insertive sex role, while Latino partners were rated the highest in likelihood of sex being hot and passionate. White partners were rated lowest on each of these domains. Longitudinal analyses found that endorsement of these stereotypes had important implications for the rate of condomless receptive and insertive anal sex with racial minority partners. Findings suggest that sexual stereotypes may contribute to the isolation of racial minority sexual networks.},

This study aims to assess the association of multiple psychosocial factors with risky sexual behaviour and HIV infection among MSM. Data on demographic characteristics, psychosocial health conditions, condomless anal intercourse (CAI), HIV testing and HIV status were collected via an anonymous online survey.

Consensus guidelines give target ranges for serum estradiol concentration based on premenopausal female reference ranges. However, limited studies have evaluated the relationship between serum estradiol concentrations and clinical outcomes in transgender individuals undergoing feminizing hormone therapy. The available evidence has not found that higher serum estradiol concentrations, together with suppressed testosterone, enhance breast development, or produce more feminine changes to body composition. However, ensuring testosterone suppression appears to be an important factor to maximize these physical changes. Higher serum estradiol concentrations have been associated with higher areal bone mineral density. Although the resultant long-term clinical implications are yet to be determined, this could be a consideration for individuals with low bone mass. The precise serum estradiol concentration that results in adequate feminization without increasing the risk of complications (thromboembolic disease, cholelithiasis) remains unknown. Further prospective trials are required.},

This study assessed (1) the prevalence of depression, recreational drug-use and sexual risk behaviour; (2) changes in these psychosocial conditions over time; and (3) the interaction of drug use and depression with sexual risk behaviour. We analysed data of the Belgian Be-PrEP-ared cohort study (N = 200). We assessed depression using the PHQ-9, recreational drug use and receptive condomless anal intercourse (rCAI) with anonymous partners. Frequencies of psychosocial problems were compared at baseline, 9 and 18 months follow-up (FU). Bivariate associations between depression and drug-use behaviour, and their interaction with rCAI with anonymous sexual partners using was examined using linear regression. Receptive CAI increased from 41\% at baseline to 53\% at M18 (p = 0.038). At baseline, we found an interaction effect of poly-drug use and depression, potentiating rCAI with anonymous partners. Participants reporting poly-drug use associated with depression were significant more likely to report this type of sexual risk behaviour than those who did not report this association (p = 0.030).

Clinicians expressed concerns in relation to risks, resource allocation, and medicalization. Some clinicians required nonbinary young people to choose a masculinizing or feminizing puberty. Some clinicians also put forward arguments in favor of long-term puberty suppression, including potential psychosocial harm of discontinuing puberty suppression, respect for autonomy, equity, and harm minimization.

Sexual minority men appear to be at risk for mental health problems due to the stress they experience in establishing and maintaining a minority sexual identity. These mental health issues may combine synergistically and lead to higher medical costs to society. We examine whether sexual minority specific syndemic indicators were associated with higher health care costs, health care utilization, or the risk of being HIV-infected. Health care consumers at a community health center (N = 1211) completed a brief screening questionnaire collected over 12 months. Self-reported data were linked with participants' clinical billing records. Adjusted logistic regression models identified that four syndemic indicators (suicidality, substance use, childhood sexual abuse, and intimate partner violence) were each significantly related to each other. Multiple syndemics significantly predicted higher medical care utilization and cost, and were associated with 2.5 times the risk of being HIV-infected (OR 2.49, 95\% CI 1.45-4.25). Syndemic indicators did not significantly predict the number of mental health visits or costs per patient. These results confirm and extend earlier findings by relating syndemics to health services use and costs for sexual minority men.},

We compared CBT-TSC to HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)-only in an initial 2-arm RCT in 43 HIV-negative MSM at with a history of CSA and HIV risk. Serodiscordant condomless anal/vaginal sex (CAS; CAS with HIV-postive or HIV unknown status partners) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (Davidson Trauma Scale: total score and avoidance, intrusions, hyperarousal subscales) were outcomes immediately post-treatment, and at 6- and 9-month follow-up. At post-treatment, CBT-TSC had decreased odds (approximately 60\%) of any CAS and greater reductions in CAS compared to VCT-only. Additionally, the CBT-TSC condition experienced greater reductions in total PTSD and avoidance symptoms. At the follow-up visits, CBT-TSC condition had significant reductions in the odds of any CAS and reductions in CAS. However, for PTSD symptoms, only the avoidance subscale remained significantly different compared to VCT-only. CBT-TSC is a potentially efficacious approach to address HIV risk in MSM with a CSA history, with replication and extension in a larger trial needed. This proof-of-concept trial is the first to integrate the treatment of a commonly occurring mental-health syndemic problem in MSM with a health psychology approach to self-care in MSM.

  abstract = {One of the most controversial policies in blood transfusion worldwide is the permanent deferral from donating blood of men with sexual contacts to other men (MSM). This policy was implemented for safety reasons as sex between men is known to be a high risk factor for acquiring severe infectious diseases transmissible by blood transfusion. Sexual contacts among heterosexual persons may hold similar risks but a clear-cut discrimination between different individual risks is impossible. Nevertheless, the current blood donor deferral periods defined by European Union (EU) legislation depend on a distinction of different grades of risk with respect to sexual behaviour. Under the aegis of the Steering Committee on Blood Transfusion (CD-P-TS) of the Council of Europe (CoE), an international working group evaluated epidemiological and behavioural data, modelling studies on residual risk and spread of infections, and studies on adherence to donor selection criteria. The aim was to distinguish sexual behaviour of different risk categories. It was concluded, that existing data confirm that MSM and commercial sex workers (CSW) are groups at high risk. Any further grading lacks a scientific data base. Modelling studies indicate that adherence to deferral policies is of major relevance suggesting that good donor adherence may outweigh the small negative effects on blood safety postulated for changing from permanent to temporary deferral periods for high risk sexual behaviours. The fact that a considerable percentage of donors are MSM - despite the permanent deferral policy - demonstrates the need to increase donor understanding and adherence.},

This study investigated the psychosocial syndemic and its relationship with risky sexual behavior among Nigeria MSM. Methods: Eighty-one MSM and 81 heterosexual men were compared for risky sexual behavior and psychosocial adversity variables-childhood adversity, intimate partner violence, depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, substance use, and a derived psychosocial syndemic score. The association between syndemic scores and risky sexual behavior was examined among MSM. Results: MSM had significantly higher rates of individual psychosocial adversities except substance use. There were significant interrelationships between the variables, and syndemic scores were associated with higher-risk sexual behavior. Conclusion: This is the first study to investigate the psychosocial syndemic and its relationship with HIV risk among African MSM.

Using data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, we analyzed weighted data from 23,999 adult transgender participants to estimate the prevalence and explore correlates of five IPV subtypes: psychological IPV, physical IPV, trans-related IPV, stalking, and forced sex committed by an intimate partner. Regression models examined race/ethnicity, gender identity, past-year incarceration, past-year sex work, and lifetime homelessness, and adjusted for annual household income, highest level of education, age, birthplace, Census region, and relationship status. The sample was racially/ethnically diverse (62.6\% White, 0.7\% Alaskan Native/American Indian, 4.7\% Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 12.7\% Black/African American, 16.5\% Latinx/Hispanic, 0.4\% Middle Eastern/North African, 2.5\% Multiracial/Not Listed), and comprised of 31.2\% transgender men, 34.2\% transgender women, 27.5\% assigned-female-at-birth nonbinary participants, and 7.1\% assigned-male-at-birth nonbinary participants. Rates of IPV were high, with variability by IPV subtype: 42.0\% endorsed psychological IPV, 39.9\% endorsed physical IPV, 30.4\% endorsed trans-related IPV, 18.0\% endorsed stalking, and 21.5\% endorsed forced sex by an intimate partner. We observed disparities in IPV subtypes by race/ethnicity, gender identity, and experiences of social marginalization. Results highlight the need for targeted, trans-inclusive IPV screening practices and interventions. Future studies should examine the syndemic effects of IPV, social marginalization, and health outcomes related to HIV, substance use, and mental health in trans populations.},

METHOD: We used latent class analysis and a sample of 14,762 U.S. high school students who participated in the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System to examine youth population profiles based on shared characteristics of syndemics. Adjusting for sociodemographic factors, we conducted logistic regression to explore the connections between psychosocial syndemic factors and three sexual risk practices, namely, early initiation of sexual intercourse, condom use, and sex with multiple partners. RESULTS: The study results indicate that three classes of risk exist among the sample: substance misuse (class 1, n = 3872, 26.2\%), normative (class 2, n = 8791, 59.6\%), and mental health problems (class 3, n = 2099, 14.2\%). Class membership of psychosocial syndemics was significantly different by gender, age group, and race. The odds of initiating sexual intercourse before age 13 were positively associated with participants belonging in the substance misuse class and the mental health problem class. The odds of using condoms during the last sexual intercourse for currently sexually active adolescents were lower for participants classified in the substance misuse class. The likelihood of reporting having sex with four or more partners in a lifetime was higher among participants belonging to the substance misuse class. CONCLUSION: The study advances our understanding of the heterogeneity of class membership associated with psychosocial syndemic risk factors among adolescents and extends our understanding of syndemics in the area of adolescent health. Thus, practitioners and policymakers can design multicomponent and multilevel school-based HIV/STI prevention programs that meet the needs of adolescents.},

However, this relationship has not been well characterized in the general population, particularly in the context of poverty. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study including a nationally-representative sample of 34{$\mkern1mu$}427 men and women in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions wave 1 (2001-2002) and wave 2 (2004-2005). METHODS: Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between syndemic factors and newly diagnosed HIV infection, and to assess how living below the poverty line (based on 2001 US Poverty Guidelines) modified this relationship. RESULTS: The proportion of participants reporting new HIV diagnosis in the past year was 0.22\%, increasing from 0.19\% among individuals with no syndemic factor to 5.1\% among those with four syndemic factors. Adjusting for potentially confounding factors, each additional syndemic factor was associated with a 47\% increase in odds of HIV infection [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.47, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-1.65]. The effect of syndemic factors was stronger among individuals living below federal poverty guidelines (aOR 1.96, 95\% CI 1.57-2.44) compared to those living above poverty guidelines (aOR 1.21, 95\% CI 1.07-1.36). CONCLUSIONS: Among the US general population, the association between co-occurring syndemic factors and incident HIV infection was stronger in the setting of poverty. Mental health interventions, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, should be considered to reduce transmission of HIV.},

We used baseline data from an HIV risk-reduction trial to examine whether a higher number of syndemic conditions was associated with higher rates of self-reported sexual risk behavior and HIV infection. Using logistic regression models, we tested for interactions between number of syndemic conditions and several potential resilience factors to identify buffering effects. Replicating previous studies, we found significant associations between numbers of syndemic conditions and higher rates of sexual risk behavior and HIV infection. Surprisingly, we also replicated a previous finding (Stall et al., Am J Public Health, 93(6):939-942, 2003) that the effects of syndemic burden on HIV status fell off at the highest levels of syndemic conditions. Among a variety of potential resilience factors, two-optimism and education-buffered the syndemic effect on HIV prevalence. This is, to our knowledge, the first paper to identify resilience factors buffering against syndemic effects among MSM. It also constitutes a significant contribution to the literature regarding prevention among black MSM. These results point to the need to identify HIV-positive black MSM and provide effective treatment for them and to develop interventions addressing both syndemic and resilience factors.},

These factors include the number of infectious diseases endemic in this population, the high rate of substance abuse problems and psychological disorders, and the significant percentage of MSM who have experienced childhood sexual abuse and other adverse events. While MSM are disproportionately affected by HIV, syphilis, and other STDs, health activists from the gay community have systematically resisted the application of the full range of public health strategies traditionally used to prevent their spread. In the more than three decades since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, there have been substantial advances in testing and treatment, yet the infection rate among MSM, and particularly young MSM, remains high, even as it has been dropping among other risk groups.

This information void has the potential to result in reviews that are inconsistent and inadequate to inform healthcare policy and decision making. The aim of this meta-epidemiological study is to describe the methodology of recently published prevalence systematic reviews. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) from February 2017 to February 2018 for systematic reviews of prevalence studies. We included systematic reviews assessing the prevalence of any clinical condition using patients as the unit of measurement and we summarized data related to reporting and methodology of the reviews. Results: A total of 235 systematic reviews of prevalence were analyzed. The median number of authors was 5 (interquartile range [IQR] 4\textendash 7), the median number of databases searched was 4 (3\textendash 6) and the median number of studies included in each review was 24 (IQR 15\textendash 41.5). Search strategies were presented for 68\% of reviews. Forty five percent of reviews received external funding, and 24\% did not provide funding information. Twenty three percent of included reviews had published or registered the systematic review protocol. Reporting guidelines were used in 72\% of reviews. The quality of included studies was assessed in 80\% of reviews. Nine reviews assessed the overall quality of evidence (4 using GRADE). Meta-analysis was conducted in 65\% of reviews; 1\% used Bayesian methods. Random effect meta-analysis was used in 94\% of reviews; among them, 75\% did not report the variance estimator used. Among the reviews with meta-analysis, 70\% did not report how data was transformed; 59\% percent conducted subgroup analysis, 38\% conducted meta-regression and 2\% estimated prediction interval; I2 was estimated in 95\% of analysis. Publication bias was examined in 48\%. The most common software used was STATA (55\%). Conclusions: Our results indicate that there are significant inconsistencies regarding how these reviews are conducted. Many of these differences arose in the assessment of methodological quality and the formal synthesis of comparable data. This variability indicates the need for clearer reporting standards and consensus on methodological guidance for systematic reviews of prevalence data.},

Using syndemic theory, we examine how HIV risk in transgender communities is embedded in multiple co-occurring public health problems, including poor mental health, substance use, violence and victimization, discrimination, and economic hardship. Although safer sex counseling and testing programs are essential platforms for HIV intervention, these modalities alone may be insufficient in reducing new infections. Multicomponent interventions are necessary to respond to the complex, interacting syndemic factors that cumulatively determine HIV vulnerability in transgender individuals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM), injection drug users (IDUs), and certain subgroups of heterosexuals are disproportionately affected by the syndemics of HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, and viral hepatitis. Although understanding the burden of these infections in these populations by urbanicity (the degree to which a geographic area is urban) is critical to targeting prevention programs, few studies have done so., METHODS: We analyzed nationally representative 1999 to 2010 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey on persons aged 18 to 59 years. We estimated the weighted prevalence of HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), human papillomavirus, chlamydia, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, stratified by urbanicity level, for the overall sample, MSM, IDUs, and heterosexuals. Geographic areas with population at least million are classified into large central and large fringe metropolitan counties., RESULTS: Overall, large central metropolitan areas had a higher prevalence of HIV, HSV-2, and hepatitis B. HIV prevalence among MSM was elevated in large central and large fringe metro areas (14.5\% and 16.9\%, respectively). Among heterosexuals, large central metropolitan areas had elevated prevalence of HSV-2, chlamydia, and hepatitis B. Human papillomavirus and hepatitis C prevalence did not vary significantly by urbanicity for any population, including IDUs., CONCLUSIONS: Infections with higher prevalence in urban areas merit a geographically focused approach to screening and prevention programs, whereas those with uniform prevalence across levels of urbanicity would benefit from a generalized prevention approach. These nationally representative, population-based data allow for more effective planning for prevention programs.},

  abstract = {Introduction\hspace{0.6em} Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionally affected by a number of health conditions that are associated with violence, stigma, discrimination, poverty, unemployment or poor healthcare access. In recent years, syndemic theory provided a framework to explore the interactions of these health disparities on the biological and social levels. Research in this field has been increasing for the past 10 years, but methodologies have evolved and sometimes differed from the original concept. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the existing literature on syndemic theory applied to MSM in order to identify knowledge gaps, inform future investigations and expand our understanding of the complex interactions between avoidable health conditions in a vulnerable population. Methods and analysis\hspace{0.6em} The proposed scoping review will follow the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley with subsequent enhancements by Levac et al, Colquhoun et al and Peters et al as well as the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\-Analyses extension for scoping review. A systematic search of MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ProQuest Sociological Abstracts will be conducted. Reference lists of the included studies will be hand-\-searched for additional studies. Screening and data charting will be achieved using DistillerSR. Data collating, summarising and reporting will be performed using R and RStudio. Tabular and graphical summaries will be presented, alongside an evidence map and a descriptive overview of the main results. Ethics and dissemination\hspace{0.6em} This scoping review does not require ethical approval. Data and code will be made accessible after manuscript submission. Final results will be disseminated through publication in a peer-\-reviewed journal and collaboration with grassroots Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex and Asexual (LGBTQIA+) organisations.

Treatment adaptations focused on reducing minority stress processes that underlie sexual orientation-related mental health disparities. Method-Young gay and bisexual men (n=63; M age=25.94) were randomized to immediate treatment or a three-month waitlist. At baseline, 3-month, and 6-month assessments, participants completed self-reports of mental health and minority stress and an interview of past-90-day risk behavior. Results-Compared to waitlist, treatment significantly reduced depressive symptoms (b=-2.43, 95\% CI: -4.90, 0.35, p{$<$}0.001), alcohol use problems (b =-3.79, 95\% CI: -5.94, -1.64, p{$<$}0.001), sexual compulsivity (b =-5.09, 95\% CI: -8.78, -1.40, p{$<$}0.001), and past-90-day condomless sex with casual partners (b =-1.09, 95\% CI: -1.80, -0.37, p{$<$}0.001), and improved condom use self-efficacy (b =10.08, 95\% CI: 3.86, 16.30, p{$<$}0.001). The treatment yielded moderate and marginally significant greater improvements than waitlist in anxiety symptoms (b =-2.14, 95\% CI: -4.61, 0.34, p=0.09) and past-90-day heavy drinking (b =-0.32, 95\% CI: -0.71, 0.07, p=0.09).

  abstract = {Developing and deploying separate treatments for separate conditions seems ill-suited to intervening upon the co-occurring, and possibly functionally similar, psychosocial conditions facing gay and bisexual men. This article argues for the need to create transdiagnostic interventions that reduce multiple syndemic conditions facing gay and bisexual men at the level of their shared source in minority stress pathways. This article first reviews psychosocial syndemic conditions affecting gay and bisexual men, then suggests pathways that might link minority stress to psychosocial syndemics based on recent advancements in emotion science, psychiatric nosology, and cognitive-affective neuroscience, and finally suggests cross-cutting psychosocial treatment principles to reduce minority stress-syndemic pathways among gay and bisexual men. Because minority stress serves as a common basis of all psychosocial syndemic conditions reviewed here, locating the pathways through which minority stress generates psychosocial syndemics and employing overarching treatment principles capable of simultaneously alleviating these pathways will ultimately create a transdiagnostic approach to improving gay and bisexual men's health. Clinical research and training approaches are suggested to further validate the pathways suggested here, establish the efficacy of treatment approaches tied to those pathways, and generate effective methods for disseminating a transdiagnostic minority stress treatment approach for gay and bisexual men's psychosocial syndemic health. Keywords Gay and bisexual men; HIV prevention; Syndemic; Psychotherapy; Mental health intervention; Sexual orientation Parallel developments in two distinct fields are converging to suggest a novel approach to improving gay and bisexual men's psychosocial health. On one hand, the public health field recognizes the inextricable nature of the multiple psychosocial health threats facing gay and bisexual communities and has adopted a syndemic perspective to explain these co-occurring health conditions (e.g.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Previous studies have found that sexual orientation concealment affords escape from stigma and discrimination but also creates a psychological toll. While disclosure alleviates the mental burden of concealment, it invites the stress of navigating a new public identity. Population-based samples that include both ``in'' and ``out'' sexual minorities provide an ideal opportunity to resolve limitations and inconsistencies of previous nonprobability investigations into the mental health correlates of concealment and disclosure. Method: Sexual minority participants in the California Quality of Life Survey (n   2,083) indicated whether and when they first disclosed their sexual orientation to others. Prevalence of 1-year major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder was derived from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview\textemdash Short Form. Results: Closeted men (n   84) were less likely to be depressed than out men, n   1,047; odds ratio (OR)   0.41; 95\% CI [0.17, 0.996]. Men who were recently out (n   201) experienced higher odds of major depressive disorder, OR   6.21; 95\% CI [1.53, 24.47], and generalized anxiety disorder, OR   5.51; 95\% CI [1.51, 20.13], as compared to closeted men. Men who were distantly out (n   846) also experienced higher odds of major depressive disorder than men who were closeted, OR   2.91; 95\% CI [1.10, 7.69]. Recently out women (n   243) experienced lower odds of depression than closeted women, n   63; OR   0.21; 95\% CI [0.05, 0.96]. Conclusion: Whether being in or out of the closet is associated with depression and anxiety largely depends on gender. Clinical and policy implications are discussed in terms of the unique stressors facing men and women both in and out of the closet.},

Results: Chemsex status was documented for 1734 of 1840 patients. Overall, 27.1\% (n = 463) disclosed current recreational drug use, of whom 286 (16.5\%) disclosed chemsex participation and 74 of 409 (18.1\%) injected drugs. GBMSM who were already HIV positive were more likely to disclose chemsex participation [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.55; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.89\textendash 3.44; P {$<$} 0.001]. Those disclosing chemsex participation had higher odds of being newly diagnosed with HIV infection (AOR 5.06; 95\% CI 2.56\textendash 10.02; P {$<$} 0.001), acute bacterial STIs (AOR 3.94; 95\% CI 3.00\textendash 5.17; P {$<$} 0.001), rectal STIs (AOR 4.45; 95\% CI 3.37\textendash 6.06; P {$<$} 0.001) and hepatitis C (AOR 9.16; 95\% CI 2.31\textendash 36.27; P = 0.002). HIV-negative chemsex participants were also more likely to have accessed post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV in the study period and to report sex with a discordant HIV- or hepatitis C virus-infected partner (P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: Chemsex disclosure in sexual health settings is associated with higher rates of STI diagnoses, including HIV infection and hepatitis C. GBMSM attending sexual health services should therefore be assessed for chemsex participation and disclosure should prompt health promotion, harm minimization and wellbeing interventions.},

The science of HIV prevention, although interdisciplinary, has relied heavily on psychological theories and research methods to address many key questions. In this paper, we briefly review some historical and epidemiologic considerations about the U.S. HIV epidemic and then present some key psychological concepts from HIV prevention. We make the case for continuing to focus efforts on gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, who represent the sociocultural group with the highest incidence and prevalence of HIV in the domestic epidemic. We present a summary of the research support for, and limitations of, the three major psychosocial models that predict HIV risk behaviors-the information-motivation-behavioral skills model, the minority stress model, and the syndemics framework. We discuss the use of these models in the development and testing of HIV prevention interventions and end by highlighting a few novel research areas, including bio-behavioral approaches.

Interventions are needed to increase HIV prevention and treatment behaviors, especially among syndemically exposed SMM. In recent years, researchers have created and tested combination behavioral interventions co-targeting syndemics and HIV-related health behaviors. We evaluated that literature via systematic review and meta-analysis, identifying 44 trials targeting mental health symptoms, alcohol use, and drug use, as well as sexual risk behavior, antiretroviral adherence, and healthcare engagement. For the randomized controlled trials, we computed between-group, pre-post effect sizes and tested them via random-effects models. Results supported the efficacy of combined interventions with significant, small, positive effects for improving mental health and reducing substance use (d = .20, CIs: 0.12, .29), and reducing sexual risk behavior and improving antiretroviral adherence (d = .16, CIs: .03, .30). Stratification analyses indicate that longer (9+ sessions) and individual (vs. group) interventions resulted in stronger effects on syndemic but not health behavior outcomes. Intervention developers should attend to intervention intensity and format. More evidence is needed about the importance of additional factors, such as novel intervention targets and cultural tailoring, as well as broadening the focus to multi-level interventions to address both interpersonal and structural mechanisms of change.},

These findings suggest that external stressors associated with being LGB can impact individuals' physiological coping resources, thus affecting their psychological health.},

METHODS: In 2003 and 2004, we conducted an anonymous cross-sectional survey of MSM in New York City (n = 669) by approaching attendees at gay, lesbian, and bisexual community events. We analyzed data by bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: We found strong positive interrelationships among syndemic factors including sexual compulsivity, depression, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and polydrug use. In bivariate analyses, all syndemic health problems except for childhood sexual abuse were positively related to HIV seropositivity and high-risk sexual behavior. Our multivariate models revealed an array of interrelationships among psychosocial health problems. We found amplified effects of these problems on HIV seropositivity and on the likelihood of engaging in high-risk sexual behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the conclusion that sexual compulsivity is a component of a syndemic framework for HIV risk among MSM. HIV prevention interventions should consider the overlapping and compounding effects of psychosocial problems, including sexual compulsivity.},

  abstract = {Among gay and bisexual men (GBM), a syndemic describes a situation in which negative conditions (e.g., childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, depression, polysubstance use) co-occur such to amplify HIV risk. Research has suggested that sexual compulsivity (SC) may also be a syndemic condition. Between 2011 and 2013, 368 highly sexually active (9+ male partners in 90~days) GBM completed a survey of syndemic factors as well as measures of sexual compulsivity (Sexual Compulsivity Scale [SCS]) and hypersexuality (hypersexual disorder screening inventory [HDSI]). Based on scores on the SCS and HDSI, participants were organized into three groups-negative on both ("Neither SC nor HD"); positive on the SCS only ("SC Only"), and positive on both the SCS and the HDSI ("Both SC and HD"). We found support for the utility of a three-group classification of sexual compulsivity/hypersexuality as one of the syndemic factors that contribute to HIV risk. The average number of syndemic factors experienced was lowest among those who experienced Neither SC nor HD and highest among the group that experienced Both SC and HD, with those experiencing SC Only falling between the two other groups. This study provided further evidence that sexual compulsivity/hypersexuality is a contributing factor to the syndemics model of HIV risk for GBM and that considering three levels of severity (i.e., SC along with HD) led to stronger model predictions than considering SC alone. SC/HD severity provides another modifiable target for HIV prevention intervention development.},

Methods: In a cross-sectional sample of MSM and TW from Lima (2012-2014), we calculated prevalence of BD (consuming {$\geq$}6 alcoholic drinks per occasion by AUDIT-3 criteria), conducted bivariate analyses of associations of BD with demographic and behavioral characteristics, and compared prevalence and behaviors of BD to those of hazardous drinkers (identified by AUDIT-10 criteria). Results: Of 1,520 MSM (n = 1,384) and TW (n = 137) with median age 27 years, 74.4\% of MSM and 86.9\% of TW met criteria for BD. Among MSM, BD was associated with a greater likelihood of using alcohol (41.6\% vs. 13.8\%; p {$<$} .01) or drugs (7.8\% vs. 2.8\%; p {$<$} .01) prior to a recent sexual contact.

  abstract = {Purpose Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has become a mainstay medical treatment option for management of gender dysphoria in transgender patients of both biologic sexes. Very little is known about the long-term effects of steroid hormone modulation on breast tissue in this population. Most of the data available on the effects of HRT on breast and reproductive tissues come from studies of postmenopausal cisgender women. Therapeutic regimens are often provider-dependent, and there, are no uniform guidelines in place for cancer surveillance in transgender patients. In this review, we present what forms of hormone therapy and hormone modulation are available to transgender patients, what is known about their effects on male and female breast tissue, and what other endogenous and exogenous factors contribute to the macroscopic and cellular changes observed. Methods A search for the existing literature focusing on therapeutic regimens and the effects of HRT on breast tissue provided the most current information available for this review. Recent evidence-based reports (since the year 2000) and reviews were given priority over anecdotal evidence and expert opinions when conflicting information was encountered. Older resources were considered when primary sources were needed. Given the paucity of available articles on this subject, all resources were given careful consideration. Results Information about the risks associated with HRT in the current literature and in this setting is limited and often conflicting, due to a scarcity of long-term studies tracking breast pathology among transgender men and women. Conclusions We conclude that the long-term effects of off-label pharmaceutical use for modulation of hormone levels and sexual characteristics in transgender patients have not been well studied. The tendency of steroid hormones to promote the growth of certain cancers also raises questions about the safety of differing doses and drug combinations. Further clinical and laboratory study is needed to better establish safety and dosing guidelines in transgender patients.},

The patient completed further laboratory evaluation as well as imaging with a pituitary magnetic resonance imaging which all revealed normal results. He was wearing a tightly fitted breast binder while awaiting bilateral mastectomy. After bilateral mastectomy prolactin normalized, suggesting breast binding as the cause of the elevated prolactin. Conclusion: This is the only case in the literature which highlights breast binding as a possible cause of an elevated prolactin level.

  abstract = {Background: Transgender individuals experience unique vulnerabilities to intimate partner violence (IPV) and may experience a disproportionate IPV burden compared with cisgender (nontransgender) individuals.             Objectives: To systematically review the quantitative literature on prevalence and correlates of IPV in transgender populations.             Search Methods: Authors searched research databases (PubMed, CINAHL), gray literature (Google), journal tables of contents, and conference abstracts, and consulted experts in the field. Authors were contacted with data requests in cases in which transgender participants were enrolled in a study, but no disaggregated statistics were provided for this population.             Selection Criteria: We included all quantitative literature published before July 2019 on prevalence and correlates of IPV victimization, perpetration, or service utilization in transgender populations. There were no restrictions by sample size, year, or location.             Data Collection and Analysis: Two independent reviewers conducted screening. One reviewer conducted extraction by using a structured database, and a second reviewer checked for mistakes or omissions. We used random-effects meta-analyses to calculate relative risks (RRs) comparing the prevalence of IPV in transgender individuals and cisgender individuals in studies in which both transgender and cisgender individuals were enrolled. We also used meta-analysis to compare IPV prevalence in assigned-female-sex-at-birth and assigned-male-sex-at-birth transgender individuals and to compare physical IPV prevalence between nonbinary and binary transgender individuals in studies that enrolled both groups.                            Main Results: We identified 85 articles from 74 unique data sets (n               total               \,=\,49\,966 transgender participants). Across studies reporting it, the median lifetime prevalence of physical IPV was 37.5\%, lifetime sexual IPV was 25.0\%, past-year physical IPV was 16.7\%, and past-year sexual IPV was 10.8\% among transgender individuals. Compared with cisgender individuals, transgender individuals were 1.7 times more likely to experience any IPV (RR\,=\,1.66; 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,1.36, 2.03), 2.2 times more likely to experience physical IPV (RR\,=\,2.19; 95\% CI\,=\,1.66, 2.88), and 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual IPV (RR\,=\,2.46; 95\% CI\,=\,1.64, 3.69). Disparities persisted when comparing to cisgender women specifically. There was no significant difference in any IPV, physical IPV, or sexual IPV prevalence between assigned-female-sex-at-birth and assigned-male-sex-at-birth individuals, nor in physical IPV prevalence between binary- and nonbinary-identified transgender individuals. IPV victimization was associated with sexual risk, substance use, and mental health burden in transgender populations.                          Authors' Conclusions: Transgender individuals experience a dramatically higher prevalence of IPV victimization compared with cisgender individuals, regardless of sex assigned at birth. IPV prevalence estimates are comparably high for assigned-male-sex-at-birth and assigned-female-sex-at-birth transgender individuals, and for binary and nonbinary transgender individuals, though more research is needed.             Public Health Implications: Evidence-based interventions are urgently needed to prevent and address IPV in this high-risk population with unique needs. Lack of legal protections against discrimination in employment, housing, and social services likely foster vulnerability to IPV. Transgender individuals should be explicitly included in US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations promoting IPV screening in primary care settings. Interventions at the policy level as well as the interpersonal and individual level are urgently needed to address epidemic levels of IPV in this marginalized, high-risk population.},

In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0-2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3-4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated , penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length.},

PARTICIPANTS Adults aged 65 years or over attending participating practices. EXPOSURE Admission to hospital (any hospital admission versus none, and post-admission versus pre-admission). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalence of potentially inappropriate prescribing assessed using 45 criteria from the Screening Tool for Older Persons' Prescription (STOPP) version 2, analysed both as rate of distinct potentially inappropriate prescribing criteria met (stratified Cox regression) and binary presence of potentially inappropriate prescribing (logistic regression) and adjusted for patients' characteristics. A sensitivity analysis used matching with propensity scores based on patients' characteristics and diagnoses. RESULTS Overall 38 229 patients were included, and during 2012 the mean age was 76.8 (SD 8.2) years and 43\% (13 212) were male. Each year, 10.4-15.0\% (3015/29 077 in 2015 to 4537/30 231 in 2014) of patients had at least one hospital admission. The overall prevalence of potentially inappropriate prescribing ranged from 45.3\% (13 940/30 789) of patients in 2012 to 51.0\% (14 823/29 077) in 2015. Independently of age, sex, number of prescription items, comorbidity, and health cover, hospital admission was associated with a higher rate of distinct potentially inappropriate prescribing criteria met; the adjusted hazard ratio for hospital admission was 1.24 (95\% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.28). Among participants who were admitted to hospital, the likelihood of potentially inappropriate prescribing after admission was higher than before admission, independent of patients' characteristics; the adjusted odds ratio for after hospital admission was 1.72 (1.63 to 1.84). Analysis of propensity score matched pairs showed a slight reduction in the hazard ratio for hospital admission to 1.22 (1.18 to 1.25). CONCLUSION Hospital admission was independently associated with potentially inappropriate prescribing. It is important to determine how hospital admission may affect appropriateness of prescribing for older people and how potential adverse consequences of admission can be minimised.},

  abstract = {Purpose Of Review: This article reviews the case for recognizing (1) the epidemics of opioid misuse, overdose, hepatitis C virus, and HIV as a syndemic and (2) the importance of examining and addressing structural factors in responses to this syndemic. We focus on the current syndemic in the US, but also consider data from other locations to highlight the issues existing and arising in various contexts.; Recent Findings: Advances in multi-level theory and statistical methods allow sound ecologic and multi-level analyses of the impact of structural factors on the syndemic. Studies of opioid misuse, overdoses, hepatitis C virus, and HIV demonstrate that area-level access to healthcare, medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorders, sterile injection equipment, and overdose prevention with naloxone, as well as factors such as opioid marketing, income inequality, intensity of policing activities, and health care policies, are related to the prevalence of substance misuse, overdoses, infection risk, and morbidity. Structural variables can predict area-level vulnerability to the syndemic. The implementation of combined prevention and treatment interventions can control and reverse components of the syndemic. Recognizing and monitoring potent structural factors can facilitate the identification of areas at risk of vulnerability to the syndemic. Further, many structural factors are modifiable through intervention and policy to reduce structural vulnerability and create health-enabling environments. Evidence supports the immediate implementation of broader HCV and HIV testing and substance use screening, medication-assisted treatment, needle/syringe exchange programs, naloxone programs, increased population-level implementation of HCV treatment, and further attention to structural-level factors predicting, and contributing to, area-level vulnerability, such as degrees of opioid marketing, distribution, and prescribing.;},

No studies have examined these concerns among early adolescents ({$<$}16 years old). The purpose of this study was to examine syndemic indicators among early adolescent sexual minority males and their associations with sexual behavior. Methods: Sexual minority males (N = 207; ages 14\textendash 17; drawn from 40 U.S. states) completed a cross-sectional online survey. Descriptive statistics were used to document profiles of syndemic indicators. Firth logistic regressions tested the associations between count of syndemic indicators and sexual behavior with male and female partners. Results: Psychosocial syndemic indicators were highly prevalent and co-occurring, with diverse psychosocial profiles. After controlling for age, race, and ethnicity, having more syndemic indicators was significantly positively associated with condomless anal sex with male partners (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.37, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.02\textendash 1.84) and vaginal and/or anal sex with females (AOR = 1.75, 95\% CI 1.25\textendash 2.47). Conclusions: This study documents the psychosocial profiles of syndemic indicators with a sample of early adolescent sexual minority males and the association of syndemic indicators with sexual behavior. Among early adolescent sexual minority males, psychosocial concerns were prevalent, similar to rates seen among adult sexual minority males, and conferred vulnerability to HIV transmission. Behavioral and psychosocial interventions must reach sexual minority males in early adolescence to address mental health and substance use concerns and to help reduce the risk of HIV acquisition.},

  abstract = {Reviews of primary research are becoming more common as evidence-based practice gains recognition as the benchmark for care, and the number of, and access to, primary research sources has grown. One of the newer review types is the 'scoping review'. In general, scoping reviews are commonly used for 'reconnaissance' - to clarify working definitions and conceptual boundaries of a topic or field. Scoping reviews are therefore particularly useful when a body of literature has not yet been comprehensively reviewed, or exhibits a complex or heterogeneous nature not amenable to a more precise systematic review of the evidence. While scoping reviews may be conducted to determine the value and probable scope of a full systematic review, they may also be undertaken as exercises in and of themselves to summarize and disseminate research findings, to identify research gaps, and to make recommendations for the future research. This article briefly introduces the reader to scoping reviews, how they are different to systematic reviews, and why they might be conducted. The methodology and guidance for the conduct of systematic scoping reviews outlined below was developed by members of the Joanna Briggs Institute and members of five Joanna Briggs Collaborating Centres.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to describe the updated methodological guidance for conducting a JBI scoping review, with a focus on new updates to the approach and development of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (the PRISMA-ScR). INTRODUCTION: Scoping reviews are an increasingly common approach to informing decision-making and research based on the identification and examination of the literature on a given topic or issue. Scoping reviews draw on evidence from any research methodology and may also include evidence from non-research sources, such as policy. In this manner, scoping reviews provide a comprehensive overview to address broader review questions than traditionally more specific systematic reviews of effectiveness or qualitative evidence. The increasing popularity of scoping reviews has been accompanied by the development of a reporting guideline: the PRISMA-ScR. In 2014, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group developed guidance for scoping reviews that received minor updates in 2017 and was most recently updated in 2020. The updates reflect ongoing and substantial developments in approaches to scoping review conduct and reporting. As such, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group recognized the need to revise the guidance to align with the current state of knowledge and reporting standards in evidence synthesis. METHODS: Between 2015 and 2020, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group expanded its membership; extensively reviewed the literature; engaged via annual face-to-face meetings, regular teleconferences, and email correspondence; sought advice from methodological experts; facilitated workshops; and presented at scientific conferences. This process led to updated guidance for scoping reviews published in the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. The updated chapter was endorsed by JBI's International Scientific Committee in 2020. RESULTS: The updated JBI guidance for scoping reviews includes additional guidance on several methodological issues, such as when a scoping review is (or is not) appropriate, and how to extract, analyze, and present results, and provides clarification for implications for practice and research. Furthermore, it is aligned with the PRISMA-ScR to ensure consistent reporting. CONCLUSIONS: The latest JBI guidance for scoping reviews provides up-to-date guidance that can be used by authors when conducting a scoping review. Furthermore, it aligns with the PRISMA-ScR, which can be used to report the conduct of a scoping review. A series of ongoing and future methodological projects identified by the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group to further refine the methodology are planned.},

It is a relatively new approach for which a universal study definition or definitive procedure has not been established. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide an overview of scoping reviews in the literature. Methods A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. A search was conducted in four bibliographic databases and the gray literature to identify scoping review studies. Review selection and characterization were performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms. Results The search identified 344 scoping reviews published from 1999 to October 2012. The reviews varied in terms of purpose, methodology, and detail of reporting. Nearly three-quarter of reviews (74.1\%) addressed a health topic. Study completion times varied from 2 weeks to 20 months, and 51\% utilized a published methodological framework. Quality assessment of included studies was infrequently performed (22.38\%). Conclusions Scoping reviews are a relatively new but increasingly common approach for mapping broad topics. Because of variability in their conduct, there is a need for their methodological standardization to ensure the utility and strength of evidence. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.

Efforts to address sexual orientation bias in new physicians are hampered by a lack of knowledge of school factors that influence bias among students. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether medical school curriculum, role modeling, diversity climate, and contact with sexual minorities predict bias among graduating students against gay and lesbian people. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 4732 first-year medical students was recruited from a stratified random sample of 49 US medical schools in the fall of 2010 (81\% response; 55\% of eligible), of which 94.5\% (4473) identified as heterosexual. Seventy-eight percent of baseline respondents (3492) completed a follow-up survey in their final semester (spring 2014). MAIN MEASURES: Medical school predictors included formal curriculum, role modeling, diversity climate, and contact with sexual minorities. Outcomes were year 4 implicit and explicit bias against gay men and lesbian women, adjusted for bias at year 1. KEY RESULTS: In multivariate models, lower explicit bias against gay men and lesbian women was associated with more favorable contact with LGBT faculty, residents, students, and patients, and perceived skill and preparedness for providing care to LGBT patients. Greater explicit bias against lesbian women was associated with discrimination reported by sexual minority students (b = 1.43 [0.16, 2.71]; p = 0.03). Lower implicit sexual orientation bias was associated with more frequent contact with LGBT faculty, residents, students, and patients (b = -0.04 [-0.07, -0.01); p = 0.008). Greater implicit bias was associated with more faculty role modeling of discriminatory behavior (b = 0.34 [0.11, 0.57); p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Medical schools may reduce bias against sexual minority patients by reducing negative role modeling, improving the diversity climate, and improving student preparedness to care for this population.},

  abstract = {Intimate partner violence is an underreported, stigmatized, and deleterious reality affecting a higher proportion of men who have sex with men (MSM) than their heterosexual counterparts. The constructs of two theories have shown strong associations with male same-sex intimate partner violence (MSSIPV). Syndemic theory suggests that many health conditions do not occur in a vacuum, but rather act synergistically, with factors reinforcing each other. Constructs of syndemic theory for MSSIPV include depression, sexual compulsivity, poly-substance use, childhood sexual abuse, and HIV infection. Minority stress theory suggests that many health conditions, including MSSIPV, may be a function of discrimination, perceived stigma, and internalized homophobia. Less is known about potential protective measures against MSSIPV, a construct captured by the community of protective measures theory which includes such factors as social support, sexual orientation "outness" (the extent to which a person's sexual orientation is known to their family, friends, co-workers and others), and safe sex behaviors (or the lack of high-risk sexual behaviors). The goal of this dissertation study was to investigate the relative contributions of the three theories to two outcome variables of MSSIPV: victimization and perpetration. This secondary analysis of an existing dataset of the correlates of syndemic theory, minority stress theory, and the community protective measures was performed to provide new information for developing interventions to address MSSIPV.

METHODS We analyzed data from 506 transgender women (1045 total visits) and 120 transgender men (209 total visits) who attended 26 publicly funded clinics that provide STD services in 6 US cities during a 3.5-year observation period. We used clinical and laboratory data to examine the proportion of transgender women and transgender men who tested positive for urogenital and extragenital chlamydial or gonococcal infections and who self-reported or tested positive for HIV infection during the observation period. RESULTS Of the transgender women tested, 13.1\% tested positive for chlamydia and 12.6\% tested positive for gonorrhea at 1 or more anatomic sites, and 14.2\% were HIV-infected. Of transgender men tested, 7.7\% and 10.5\% tested positive for chlamydia and gonorrhea at 1 or more anatomic sites, and 8.3\% were HIV-infected. Most transgender women (86.0\% and 80.9\%, respectively) and more than a quarter of transgender men (28.6\% and 28.6\%, respectively) with an extragenital chlamydial or gonococcal infection had a negative urogenital test at the same visit. CONCLUSIONS Publicly funded clinics providing STD services are likely an important source of STD care for transgender persons. More data are needed to understand the most effective screening approaches for urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in transgender populations.},

Less is known about moderating factors that may attenuate the relation between syndemic conditions and sexual risk-taking. We examined disclosure of same-sex sexual behavior or "outness" as a moderating factor of the syndemic effect. We recruited a sample of MSM (n = 191) using respondent-driven sampling in Tijuana, Mexico. Participants completed a survey of syndemic conditions (i.e., substance use, depression, violence, internalized homophobia, and sexual compulsivity), sexual risk-taking (i.e., condom unprotected anal sex with a stranger in the past 2 months), and the degree to which they are "out" about sex with men. Consistent with previous research, we found that men who report more syndemic conditions show a greater prevalence of sexual risk-taking. As predicted, men who were out to more people showed a weaker association between syndemic conditions and sexual risk-taking, whereas men who were out to fewer people showed the strongest association. This study is the first to provide evidence of "outness" as a moderating factor that attenuates syndemic effects on sexual risk-taking. Building upon previous research, the data suggest that "outness" may be a resilience factor for MSM in Tijuana. HIV prevention intervention implications are discussed.},

Methods: National surveillance of hepatitis A, including reference laboratory confirmation and molecular sequencing, and a case questionnaire, was enhanced in 2017 to collect demographic and risk information, disease severity and healthcare utilisation. National Health Service (NHS) data was used to calculate associated healthcare costs. Results: During the outbreak period (July 2016 to January 2018), 670 confirmed cases were identified in England, caused by three distinct viral strains. The public health response included raising public and professional awareness, reinforcing vaccine recommendations for MSM, contact tracing for postexposure vaccination, and mass community vaccination where spill-over of infection into the general population occurred. Hepatitis A vaccine was centrally procured to ensure sexual health clinics in England could offer vaccination to MSM. Outbreak associated healthcare costs were estimated to be approximately \textsterling 1,500,000. Conclusions: While MSM are at increased risk of hepatitis A infection, inconsistent implementation of MSM vaccination policy in previous years led to an increasingly susceptible MSM population. The large number of cases, hospital admission rate and public health actions contributed to a significant healthcare burden. Recommending hepatitis A vaccination for MSM and clarifying commissioning responsibilities is essential to prevent future outbreaks.},

It has been also suggested that bisexual individuals (both men and women) have higher rates of depression and anxiety compared with homosexual and heterosexual groups. AIM: The aim of the present article was to determine whether or not an association between bisexuality and suicidal behavior exists and to analyze risk factors for suicidal behavior in bisexual individuals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The combined search strategies yielded a total of 339 records screened from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge. Duplicate articles, articles that were not in English, and those that did not analyze bisexuality separately from homosexuality were excluded. A quality assessment was performed for each study included. METHODS: A careful systematic review of the literature was conducted investigating the potential bisexuality-suicidal behavior link. A total of 77 articles from peer-reviewed journals were considered, and the most relevant (N = 19) were selected for this review. RESULTS: Individuals reporting a bisexual orientation had an increased risk of suicide attempts and ideation compared with their homosexual and heterosexual peers. Risk factors included related victimization, peer judgments, and family rejection. Bisexual individuals also reported higher rates of mental illness and substance abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Bisexual individuals may experience more psychological distress and mental health problems than individuals who identify with a homosexual or heterosexual orientation. Clinicians should consider the potential for suicidal behaviors in bisexual individuals and be alert for increased mental health problems and poor social integration. Language: en},

We propose here a measure of similarity between vertices based on random walks which has several important advantages: it captures well the community structure in a network, it can be computed efficiently, and it can be used in an agglomerative algorithm to compute efficiently the community structure of a network. We propose such an algorithm, called Walktrap, which runs in time O(mn2) and space O(n2) in the worst case, and in time O(n2 log n) and space O(n2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph). Extensive comparison tests show that our algorithm surpasses previously proposed ones concerning the quality of the obtained community structures and that it stands among the best ones concerning the running time.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Transgender populations have been underrepresented in HIV epidemiologic studies and consequently in HIV prevention, care, and treatment programs. Since 2012, there has been a dramatic increase in research focused on transgender people. Studies highlight the burden of HIV and risk determinants, including intersecting stigmas, as drivers of syndemics among transgender populations. This review synthesizes the most recent global epidemiology of HIV infection and describes current gaps in research and interventions to inform prioritization of HIV research for transgender populations. Methods: A systematic review was conducted of the medical literature published between January 1, 2012 and November 30, 2015. The data focused on HIV prevalence, determinants of risk, and syndemics among transgender populations. Results: Estimates varied dramatically by location and subpopula-tion. Transfeminine individuals have some of the highest concen-trated HIV epidemics in the world with laboratory-confirmed prevalence up to 40\%. Data were sparse among trans masculine individuals; however, they suggest potential increased risk for trans masculine men who have sex with men (MSM). No prevalence data were available for transgender people across Sub-Saharan Africa or Eastern Europe/Central Asia. Emerging data consistently support the association of syndemic conditions with HIV risk in transgender populations. Discussion: Addressing syndemic conditions and gender-specific challenges is critical to ensure engagement and retention in HIV prevention by transgender populations. Future research should prioritize: filling knowledge gaps in HIV epidemiology; elucidating how stigma shapes syndemic factors to produce HIV and other deleterious effects on transgender health; and understanding how to effectively implement HIV interventions for transgender people.},

Most existing interventions target behavior change among transgender women, with only one HIV prevention program evaluated for transgender men. Studies addressing biomedical interventions for transgender women are ongoing. Few interventions address social and structural barriers to HIV prevention, such as stigma, discrimination, and poverty. Summary: Evidence-based multi-level interventions that address the structural, biomedical, and behavioral risks for HIV among transgender populations, including transgender men, are needed to address disparities in HIV prevalence. Future research should address not only pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake and condom use but also structural barriers that limit access to these prevention strategies.},

Complexities of sexuality and gender affect HIV vulnerability for this group, including not identifying with conventional sexual orientation categories (eg, bisexual, heterosexual, or gay) and having attractions based on gender role or expression rather than genital anatomy. Only one HIV prevention interventional study in this population was identified, and one study that assessed the perceived acceptability of an intervention. We found no data for interventions using pre-exposure prophylaxis, interventions for cisgender men with transgender men partners, or cisgender men with casual or transactional sexual partnerships with transgender people. Cisgender men with transgender partners are not easily categorised using traditional HIV risk categories. Additional research is needed to understand stigma and other structural drivers of HIV vulnerability, sexual networks and practices, substance use patterns, and biomedical prevention interest and uptake for this group. Studies that use an intersectional lens and syndemic framework could offer key insights.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Past research investigating syndemic factors and HIV-related outcomes has overlooked the impact of structural conditions on behaviours linked with HIV transmission and disease progression. Given prevalent substance use among our sample, we explored whether four structural conditions indicative of social marginalisation and previously correlated with increased risk for HIV infection demonstrated syndemic (additive/synergistic) effects on: (i) HIV viral suppression; and (ii) self-reported involvement in sexual HIV transmission behaviours among a prospective cohort mostly comprising men of colour who have sex with men (MCSM; i.e. Latino/Hispanic and African American/black men) in Los Angeles County. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected between August 2014 and March 2017. The structural conditions of interest were: current unemployment, recent ({$\leq$}6 months) incarceration history, 'unstable' accommodation (past month) and remote ({$>$}6 months) contact with health-care providers. Generalised estimating equations assessed possible additive effects of experiencing multiple structural conditions, and possible synergistic effects on the HIV-related outcomes. RESULTS: Of 428 participants, nearly half (49\%) were HIV-positive at baseline. Involvement in sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours varied over follow-up (22-30\%). Reporting {$\geq$}2 structural syndemic conditions was significantly associated with reporting sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours among HIV-negative participants, and detectable viral load among HIV-positive participants. Frequent methamphetamine use was consistently associated with the HIV-related outcomes across the final multivariate models. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: When developing initiatives to address HIV transmission among marginalised sub-populations including MCSM, we must holistically consider systemic and structural issues (e.g. unemployment and homelessness), especially in the context of prevalent substance use.},

  abstract = {Little research has explored the link between the behavioural effects of testosterone use among transmen and HIV risk. We conducted a mixed methods study to explore testosterone use among transmen and the behavioural effects on HIV risk. A sample of 122 transmen from San Francisco participated in a cross-sectional quantitative survey and 14 transmen participated in 2 focus group discussions. Most participants (81.9\%) were currently taking hormones. Participants attributed testosterone use to new sexual behaviours among 69\% of transmen, changes in sexual attraction (49\%), and increased frequency of sexual activity (72\%). Among current testosterone users, 3.3\% had cisgender men as partners before starting testosterone, whereas after starting testosterone, 25.4\% did. Similarly, 4.1\% had a transgender woman as a sexual partner before starting testosterone and 13.9\% after starting testosterone. Findings suggest that testosterone's side effects were associated with transmen's desires for sex with cisgender men who have sex with men. The reported increase in attraction to and sex with partners from populations with a high HIV prevalence may have important implications for HIV risk among transmen, especially as the availability of transgender health services may draw transmen to a context in which HIV prevalence is high.},

To evaluate the effectiveness of predonation procedures, we studied both the characteristics and the undisclosed risk behaviours of HIV-positive donors.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the data from the Italian blood donor surveillance system in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Based on the postdonation interview, HIV-positive donors were classified by risk behaviour (heterosexual, MSM, 'non-sexual' and 'not determined') and by time elapsed from risk behaviour to donation. In Italy, the temporary deferral for exposure to behaviour at risk is 4 months.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: In the postdonation interview, 113 HIV-positive donors (32{$\cdot$}4\%), who denied at-risk behaviours in the predonation selection, reported sexual risk behaviours {$<$}4 months prior to donation; they were predominantly males (84{$\cdot$}1\%) and RTD (63{$\cdot$}7\%). The main reason for not having reported the risk behaviour in the predonation selection was 'not realizing having engaged in at-risk behaviour' (66{$\cdot$}4\%).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: These findings underline the need for more comprehensible educational material, a clearer predonation questionnaire, and effective information campaigns to improve the awareness of HIV sexual risk behaviours among blood donors.},

In order to understand the impact of IPV on HIV disease management, a universal screening program was implemented in the Southern Alberta Clinic in May 2009. We evaluated our IPV screening protocol and made recommendations for its usage in HIV care. IPV data obtained from patients were evaluated, supplemented with responses from a subset of in-depth interviews. 35\% of 1721 patients reported experiencing IPV. Prevalence was higher among females (46\%), Aboriginal Canadians (67\%), bisexual male/females (48\%), and gay males (35\%). Of 158 patients interviewed, only 22\% had previously been asked about IPV in any health care setting. Patients were responsive to routine IPV screening emphasizing that referral services need to be easily accessible. 23\% of patients disclosing IPV subsequently connected to additional IPV resources after screening. We recommend that universal IPV screening be incorporated within regular HIV clinic care. The IPV survey should be given after trust has been established with regular follow-up every 6-12 months. A referral process to local agencies dealing with IPV must be in place for patients disclosing abuses.},

  author = {Reed, Sarah J},
  address = {{US}},
  abstract = {Syndemics theory suggests that there are overlapping, synergistic epidemics that contribute to HIV risk in culturally and socioeconomically marginalized communities. As a conceptual framework, syndemics postulates that HIV is only one of many social problems that infringes upon the health of affected communities. The seminal syndemics literature urges researchers and scholars to identify the socio-cultural antecedents of syndemic production and the conditions facilitative of health and well-being; however, much of the syndemics literature has prioritized the identification of syndemics, rather than the causes of syndemics or the factors that preclude syndemic production. The conceptual syndemics literature is evolving to include attention to protective factors that inhibit or mitigate health problems or risk behavior. In this dissertation, I examined relational factors associated with the avoidance of syndemic production among a group disproportionately likely to be affected by HIV: young Black gay and bisexual men. Using analytic induction, I analyzed the relational lives of 23 young Black gay and bisexual who have avoided syndemic production (i.e., the expression of psychosocial health issues associated with heightened risk for HIV) to examine how relationships and relational factors promote young men's healthy development and sexual health. Using theoretical sampling, I also examined the narratives of 23 young men who evinced syndemic production associated with heighted HIV risk as a means of exploring how they differ in their relational characteristics from men who have avoided syndemics. The young men who avoided syndemic production had rich, fulfilling, supportive relational lives that included relationships with empathic others who supported them as young Black gay and bisexual men, helped them develop a strong sense of personal identity, and provided them with opportunities to give back to their communities. They also had diverse relational networks of people -particularly family members, male friends, and men in the gay community- who promoted pro-social norms about health behaviors. In contrast, the young men experiencing syndemics described numerous instances of trauma and oppression that infringed upon their desire or ability to form strong, healthy relational connections. In these men, pervasive experiences of oppression were associated with shame, identity incongruence, social isolation, relational disconnect, mistrust in other men, and expectations of further rejection and marginalization. Participants' different relational experiences were examined through community psychology's conceptualization of sense of community. As an initial glimpse into relational resilience among young Black gay and bisexual men, results of this study provide evidence for a number of strength-based intervention strategies that researchers may utilize not just in HIV prevention programs, but also in addressing antecedent psychosocial health conditions (i.e., syndemics) that increase vulnerability to HIV. As means of attenuating men's socio-structural barriers to health and addressing comorbid psychosocial health issues, interventions must address young men's social isolation, identity-related issues, and sense of community.

Studies consistently document a high prevalence of adverse health outcomes in this population, including HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, mental health distress, and substance use and abuse. However, many other health areas remain understudied, population-based representative samples and longitudinal studies are few, and routine surveillance efforts for transgender population health are scarce. The absence of survey items with which to identify transgender respondents in general surveys often restricts the availability of data with which to estimate the magnitude of health inequities and characterise the population-level health of transgender people globally. Despite the limitations, there are sufficient data highlighting the unique biological, behavioural, social, and structural contextual factors surrounding health risks and resiliencies for transgender people. To mitigate these risks and foster resilience, a comprehensive approach is needed that includes gender affirmation as a public health framework, improved health systems and access to health care informed by high quality data, and effective partnerships with local transgender communities to ensure responsiveness of and cultural specificity in programming. Consideration of transgender health underscores the need to explicitly consider sex and gender pathways in epidemiological research and public health surveillance more broadly.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2016, The Society of Behavioral Medicine. Background: Minority stress theory represents the most plausible conceptual framework for explaining health disparities for gay and bisexual men (GBM). However, little focus has been given to including the unique stressors experienced by HIV-positive GBM. Purpose: We explored the role of HIV-related stress within a minority stress model of mental health and condomless anal sex. Methods: Longitudinal data were collected on a diverse convenience sample of 138 highly sexually active, HIV-positive GBM in NYC regarding sexual minority (internalized homonegativity and gay-related rejection sensitivity) and HIV-related stressors (internalized HIV stigma and HIV-related re jection sensitivity), emotion dysregulation, mental health (symptoms of depression, anxiety, sexual compulsivity, and hypersexuality), and sexual behavior (condomless anal sex with all male partners and with serodiscordant male partners). Results: Across both sexual minority and HIV-related stressors, internalized stigma was significantly associated with mental health and sexual behavior outcomes while rejection sensitivity was not. Moreover, path analyses revealed that emotion dysregulation mediated the influence of both forms of internalized stigma on symptoms of depression/anxiety and sexual compulsivity/hypersexuality as well as serodiscordant condomless anal sex. Conclusions: We identified two targets of behavioral interventions that may lead to improvements in mental health and reductions in sexual transmission risk behaviors\textemdash maladaptive cognitions underlying negative self-schemas and difficulties with emotion regulation. Techniques for cognitive restructuring and emotion regulation may be particularly useful in the development of interventions that are sensitive to the needs of this population while also highlighting the important role that structural interventions can have in preventing these disparities for future generations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Integration of feminizing hormone therapy (FHT) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical in providing gender-affirming HIV care for transgender (trans) women living with HIV. However, interpersonal communications with HIV providers who are not competent with FHT may complicate this integration. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with trans women (n = 9) who self-reported as HIV-positive and their HIV providers (n = 15) from community-based venues (e.g., clinics) in Manila, Philippines. RESULTS: We identified five key themes from our qualitative data: (1) provider's concerns; (2) patient's goals; (3) affirmative vs. non-affirmative provider rhetoric; (4) alignment vs. misalignment of provider rhetoric to patient goals; and (5) FHT and ART-related decisions. Based on these themes, we describe a gender-affirmative HIV care framework to understand FHT-ART decisions among trans women living with HIV. Based on our data, this framework shows that provider-patient communications regarding ART and FHT consists primarily of provider concerns and patient goals regarding FHT. These communications can take on a gender-affirmative or non-affirmative style of rhetoric that either aligns or misaligns with patient goals and may lead to differences in FHT and ART-related decisions among trans women living with HIV. CONCLUSION: There exist mixed regimens and beliefs about taking FHT and ART among this sample of trans women. While trans participants' main source of health information is their HIV provider, providers are likely to communicate non-affirmative rhetoric that negatively impacts trans women's decision to take FHT and ART. Research is needed to elucidate co-prescriptions of gender-affirmative services with HIV care among this group in the Philippines.},

Aim To evaluate the psychobiological correlates of SD and assess the effects of HT on SD in transgender persons without gender-affirming surgery. Methods A consecutive series of 301 transgender persons (160 transwomen and 141 transmen) was considered for the cross-sectional study, and a subset of 72 subjects was studied in a 2-year follow-up. A physical examination was performed. Blood samples were drawn for determination of cortisol levels. Subjects completed psychometric measures. During 2 years of HT, the evaluation of SD was prospectively repeated. Main Outcome Measure Psychobiological correlates of SD in transgender population. Changes in SD during gender affirming hormonal treatment. Clinical Implications Knowing how hormonal treatment influence SD will help care providers when counseling transgender people. Strengths \& Limitations To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study prospectively evaluating the impact of gender affirming hormonal treatment on sexual distress in transgender individuals. The main limitations are represented by the small size of the sample and the use of questionnaires validated only in the cisgender population. Results SD showed a positive correlation with body uneasiness (P {$<$} .0001) and with dissatisfaction toward gender-related body parts or shapes (all P {$<$} .05). In addition, SD correlated positively with general psychopathology (P {$<$} .0001), alexithymia, social anxiety, and humiliation scales (all P {$<$} .05). In transmen, SD was positively associated with autism levels (P {$<$} .005), as well as with cortisol levels (P {$<$} .02). A significant correlation between SD and perceived discrimination was observed in transwomen (P {$<$} .05). In transwomen, SD was positively associated with hair density and negatively with breast growth (both P {$<$} .05). Finally, in transmen, a negative correlation was found between SD and hair density (P {$<$} .05). When the impact of HT on SD was evaluated, a significant reduction of SD was observed across time in both transwomen and transmen (P = .001 and P = .01, respectively). Conclusions The present results support the efficacy of HT in reducing SD in transgender persons. Ristori J, Cocchetti C, Castellini G, et al.

  abstract = {Background Substance use and condomless sexual behaviours are both well studied in sexual minority men, but few researchers have used event-level data collection to examine sexualised drug use in sexual and gender minority young adults. The aim of this study is to describe the co-occurrence of sex under the influence of substances and condomless sexual behaviours, using nuanced event-level data, in a racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample in New York City. Methods Data from one wave of a cohort of sexual and gender minority young adults who were assigned male at birth (n = 500) were used to characterise co-occurrence of sex under the influence of drugs and condomless sexual behaviours (oral receptive, anal insertive, and anal receptive sex), in the last 30 days. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess associations between sex while high and condomless sexual behaviours, controlling for sociodemographic factors. Results Preliminary analyses indicated significant associations between engaging in sex while high and condomless sexual behaviours. In unadjusted regression models, sexualised and non-sexualised drug use were both significantly associated with increased odds of condomless sexual behaviours. In adjusted models, sexualised drug use remained significantly associated with condomless anal insertive sex (AOR = 3.57) and condomless anal receptive sex (AOR = 4.98). Having multiple sexual partners was also significantly associated with greater odds of condomless sexual activity in all three adjusted models. Conclusion Multivariable analyses indicated that engaging in sex while high on any drug was associated with increased condomless sexual behaviour, but that sexualised drug use was associated with particularly elevated condomless anal sex. These findings provide insight for understanding the co-occurrence of substance use and condomless sex, and suggest a need for HIV/STI risk reduction strategies that address the role of sexualised drug use.},

  abstract = {Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent endocrine-metabolic disorder that implies various severe consequences to female health, including alarming rates of infertility. Although its exact etiology remains elusive, it is known to feature several hormonal disturbances, including hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance (IR), and hyperinsulinemia. Insulin appears to disrupt all components of the hypothalamus-hypophysis-ovary axis, and ovarian tissue insulin resistance results in impaired metabolic signaling but intact mitogenic and steroidogenic activity, favoring hyperandrogenemia, which appears to be the main culprit of the clinical picture in PCOS. In turn, androgens may lead back to IR by increasing levels of free fatty acids and modifying muscle tissue composition and functionality, perpetuating this IR-hyperinsulinemia-hyperandrogenemia cycle. Nonobese women with PCOS showcase several differential features, with unique biochemical and hormonal profiles. Nevertheless, lean and obese patients have chronic inflammation mediating the long term cardiometabolic complications and comorbidities observed in women with PCOS, including dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Given these severe implications, it is important to thoroughly understand the pathophysiologic interconnections underlying PCOS, in order to provide superior therapeutic strategies and warrant improved quality of life to women with this syndrome.},

Results revealed a medium mean effect size of sexual compulsivity, the strength of which was significantly moderated by type of psychosocial syndemic indicator. Significant mean effect sizes for all syndemic indicators on sexual compulsivity were found, with depression and anxiety having the strongest relationships; significant moderating effects were found and are discussed.

In particular, limited involvement in gay/lesbian activities was associated with more unprotected sex. Negative attitudes toward homosexuality were related directly to more unprotected sex, and they were related indirectly to more unprotected sex by means of increasing emotional distress.

Cluster analytic techniques identified two patterns of sexual identity formation (i.e., early and more recent), and three patterns of sexual identity integration (i.e., high, middling, and low).

This report longitudinally examines whether different patterns of LGB identity formation and integration are associated with indicators of psychological adjustment among an ethnically diverse sample of 156 LGB youths (ages 14-21) in New York City. Although differences in the timing of identity formation were not associated with psychological adjustment, greater identity integration was related to less depressive and anxious symptoms, fewer conduct problems, and higher self-esteem both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Individual changes in identity integration over time were associated with all four aspects of psychological adjustment, even after controlling for rival hypotheses concerning family and friend support, gay-related stress, negative social relationships, and other covariates. These findings suggest that difficulties in developing an integrated LGB identity may have negative implications for the psychological adjustment of LGB youths and that efforts to reduce distress among LGB youths should address the youths' identity integration.

We sought to determine the social and individual variables associated with IH and the associations between IH and HIV-related behaviours.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nDESIGN AND SETTING: We examined IH and its predictors as part of a larger Internet-delivered, cross-sectional study on HIV and health in MSM in 38 European countries.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nPARTICIPANTS: 181 495 MSM, IH data analysis subsample 144 177. All participants were male, over the age of consent for homosexual activity in their country of domicile, and have had at least one homosexual contact in the past 6 months.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODOLOGY: An anonymous Internet-based questionnaire was disseminated in 25 languages through MSM social media, websites and organisations and responses saved to a UK-based server. IH was measured using a standardised, cross-culturally appropriate scale.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Three clusters of European countries based on the level of experienced discrimination emerged. IH was predicted by country LGB (lesbian, gay and bisexual) legal climate, Gini coefficient and size of place of settlement. Lower IH was associated with degree the respondent was 'out' as gay to others and older age. 'Outness' was associated with ever having an HIV test and age, education and number of gay friends, while IH (controlling for the number of non-steady unprotected sex partners and perceived lack of control over safe sex) was associated with condom use for anal intercourse.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: IH is associated with LGB legal climate, economic development indices and urbanisation. It is also associated with 'outness' and with HIV risk and preventive behaviours including HIV testing, perceived control over sexual risk and condom use. Homonegative climate is associated with IH and higher levels of HIV-associated risk in MSM. Reducing IH through attention to LGB human rights may be appropriate HIV reduction intervention for MSM.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, evidence has accumulated to suggest that bisexual people experience higher rates of poor mental health outcomes compared to both heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals. However, no previous meta-analyses have been conducted to establish the magnitude of these disparities. To address this research gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported bisexual-specific data on standardized measures of depression or anxiety. Of the 1,074 full-text articles reviewed, 1,023 were ineligible, predominantly because they did not report separate data for bisexual people (n = 562 studies). Ultimately, 52 eligible studies could be pooled in the analysis. Results indicate that across both outcomes, there is a consistent pattern of lowest rates of depression and anxiety among heterosexual people, while bisexual people exhibit higher or equivalent rates in comparison to lesbian/gay people. On the basis of empirical and theoretical literature, we propose three interrelated contributors to these disparities: experiences of sexual orientation-based discrimination, bisexual invisibility/erasure, and lack of bisexual-affirmative support. Implications for interventions to improve the health and well-being of bisexual people are proposed.},

We explored the following two hypotheses: 1) Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals who had never disclosed their sexual orientation to a parent would report higher levels of risk behaviors and poorer health conditions than those who had come out; and 2) among LGB respondents who had come out to their parents, the individuals whose parents had reacted unsupportively would report higher levels of risk behaviors and poorer health conditions than those who had come out to parents who were supportive. Approximately two thirds of gay and bisexual (GB) males and lesbian and bisexual (LB) females reported receiving adequate social and emotional support from the parent to whom they first disclosed their sexual orientation. Among LB females, no disclosure of sexual orientation to a parent was associated with significantly elevated levels of past-month illicit drug use (AOR 12.16, 95\% CI 2.87-51.54), fair or poor self-reported health status (AOR 5.71, 95\% CI 1.45-22.51), and {$>$}15 days of depression in the past month (AOR 5.95, 95\% CI 1.78-19.90), controlling for potential confounders. However, nondisclosure to a parent by GB males was not associated with greater odds of any of the health indicators assessed. Among GB males, those with unsupportive parents were significantly more likely to report current binge drinking (AOR 6.94, 95\% CI 1.70-28.35) and {$>$}15 days depression in the past month (AOR 6.08, 95\% CI 1.15-32.15), and among LB females, those with unsupportive parents were significantly more likely to report lifetime illicit drug use (AOR 11.43, 95\% CI 2.50-52.30), and {$>$}15 days depression in the past month (AOR 5.51, 95\% CI 1.36-22.36). We conclude that coming out may be associated with better health for LB women, and that parents who react nonsupportively when their children disclose LGB sexual orientation may contribute to children's increased odds of depression and hazardous substance use.},

METHODS: Data from the Add Health Study were examined. Youths reporting same-sex and both-sex romantic attractions and relationships were compared with those reporting opposite-sex attractions. Survey regression and logistic regression were used to control for sample design effects. RESULTS: In the case of certain outcomes, romantic attraction affected males differently than females. Youths with both-sex attractions were at a somewhat higher risk for substance use and abuse than were heterosexual youths; females with same-sex attractions were also at higher risk for some outcomes. Sexual-minority youths varied little from heterosexual youths in regard to trajectories of substance use and abuse. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between youths with only same-sex attractions and those with both-sex attractions. These findings also call into question previous findings indicating that sexual-minority youths are automatically "at risk."},

  abstract = {The golden age of cannabis pharmacology began in the 1960s as Raphael Mechoulam and his colleagues in Israel isolated and synthesized cannabidiol, tetrahydrocannabinol, and other phytocannabinoids. Initially, THC garnered most research interest with sporadic attention to cannabidiol, which has only rekindled in the last 15 years through a demonstration of its remarkably versatile pharmacology and synergy with THC. Gradually a cognizance of the potential of other phytocannabinoids has developed. Contemporaneous assessment of cannabis pharmacology must be even far more inclusive. Medical and recreational consumers alike have long believed in unique attributes of certain cannabis chemovars despite their similarity in cannabinoid profiles. This has focused additional research on the pharmacological contributions of mono- and sesquiterpenoids to the effects of cannabis flower preparations. Investigation reveals these aromatic compounds to contribute modulatory and therapeutic roles in the cannabis entourage far beyond expectations considering their modest concentrations in the plant. Synergistic relationships of the terpenoids to cannabinoids will be highlighted and include many complementary roles to boost therapeutic efficacy in treatment of pain, psychiatric disorders, cancer, and numerous other areas. Additional parts of the cannabis plant provide a wide and distinct variety of other compounds of pharmacological interest, including the triterpenoid friedelin from the roots, canniprene from the fan leaves, cannabisin from seed coats, and cannflavin A from seed sprouts. This chapter will explore the unique attributes of these agents and demonstrate how cannabis may yet fulfil its potential as Mechoulam's professed ``pharmacological treasure trove.''},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined specific family rejecting reactions to sexual orientation and gender expression during adolescence as predictors of current health problems in a sample of lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults. METHODS: On the basis of previously collected in-depth interviews, we developed quantitative scales to assess retrospectively in young adults the frequency of parental and caregiver reactions to a lesbian, gay, or bisexual sexual orientation during adolescence. Our survey instrument also included measures of 9 negative health indicators, including mental health, substance abuse, and sexual risk. The survey was administered to a sample of 224 white and Latino self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults, aged 21 to 25, recruited through diverse venues and organizations. Participants completed self-report questionnaires by using either computer-assisted or pencil-and-paper surveys. RESULTS: Higher rates of family rejection were significantly associated with poorer health outcomes. On the basis of odds ratios, lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults who reported higher levels of family rejection during adolescence were 8.4 times more likely to report having attempted suicide, 5.9 times more likely to report high levels of depression, 3.4 times more likely to use illegal drugs, and 3.4 times more likely to report having engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse compared with peers from families that reported no or low levels of family rejection. Latino men reported the highest number of negative family reactions to their sexual orientation in adolescence. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes a clear link between specific parental and caregiver rejecting behaviors and negative health problems in young lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults. Providers who serve this population should assess and help educate families about the impact of rejecting behaviors. Counseling families, providing anticipatory guidance, and referring families for counseling and support can help make a critical difference in helping decrease risk and increasing well-being for lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Among men who have sex with men (MSM), HIV sexual risk and poor self-care behavior is associated with syndemics, or co-occurring psychosocial problems. Though prior research has demonstrated an additive total effect of syndemics on HIV risk behavior and infection, mostly within cross-sectional designs, it is possible that these associations are not direct but rather that syndemics disrupt relevant individual-level mediating psychological variables. One of the more common individual-level psychological variables that predicts health behavior generally, and HIV risk behavior specifically, is self-efficacy. This study sought to examine the potential effects of syndemics on condomless sex via condom-use self-efficacy as an intermediary variable. METHOD: In high-risk MSM (N = 197), across 3 time points (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months) we used latent growth curve modeling to test the degree to which self-efficacy mediated the relationship between syndemics (heavy alcohol use, substance use disorder, sexual compulsivity, depression, social anxiety, intimate partner violence, childhood sexual abuse) and condomless anal sex. RESULTS: The baseline analyses were consistent with an indirect effect of the association between syndemics and condomless sex through self-efficacy. Prospective longitudinal mediation was partially supported, such that baseline syndemics were associated with lower baseline self-efficacy, which in turn predicted higher increases in condomless anal sex across time. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence (due to the partial support for the longitudinal model) that syndemics themselves may not be directly causal in their association with condomless sex, but the association may be through modifiable social-cognitive mechanisms such as condom self-efficacy.

These overlapping epidemics, or syndemics, are exacerbated by challenges these same populations face in accessing sexual/gender minority-affirming services. Many publicly funded STI clinics are a low barrier and provide sexual minority-competent care. These sites therefore may be uniquely situated to address clients' MHSU-related needs., OBJECTIVE: We characterize the need and desire for MHSU services among STI clinic clients., DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a waiting room survey at 6 STI clinics in Metro Vancouver, Canada., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We calculated the proportion of clients with self-reported unmet MHSU needs in the previous 12 months and, among these clients, barriers to accessing MHSU services and desire for MHSU services within the STI clinic. We also examined social disparities in barriers to accessing MHSU services., RESULTS: Among 1115 respondents-65\% of whom were sexual minorities-39\% reported a recent need for MHSU-related care, most frequently in relation to anxiety (29\%), depression (26\%), substance use (10\%), or suicide ideation (7\%). Seventy-two percent of this group had not yet talked to a provider about their concern. Common barriers included shame (26\%) and inability to afford the service (24\%). Eighty-three percent of clients with unmet MHSU needs indicated that they were comfortable discussing MHSU concerns with an STI clinic provider, and 94\% expressed desire to receive MHSU assessments, referrals, or counseling in the STI clinic. Sexual and gender minorities and those attending a suburban clinic were more likely to report barriers to accessing MHSU services., CONCLUSIONS: More than a quarter of STI clinic clients report unmet MHSU health care needs; moreover, these clients report high levels of comfort with and desire to discuss MHSU concerns with STI clinic providers. Sexually transmitted infections clinics are thus opportune sites for syndemic service integration.},

Approximately 75\% of respondents indicated that parents were moderately to fully accepting at time of disclosure. Approximately 15\% said their parents were fully or almost fully rejecting at time of disclosure, with about half eventually becoming more accepting. Perceived parental acceptance of gay and lesbian children, but not bisexual daughters, improved over time. Increased parental acceptance was attributed to multiple factors including repeated adolescent-initiated conversations about sexual identity, parental exposure to LGB individuals, and parental love and commitment to the relationship., (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},

  abstract = {Some gay men are preoccupied with traditional notions of masculinity and express negative feelings towards effeminate behavior in gay men. Various scholars have speculated that such attitudes by gay men reflect internalized negative feelings about being gay. Thus, we sought to assess the importance of masculinity among gay men, to compare their ideal versus perceived masculinity-femininity, to ask how gay men assess masculinity, and to test whether masculine consciousness and anti-effeminacy could predict negative feelings about being gay. Results from an online survey of 751 gay men in the United States (MAge=32.64 years, SD=11.94) showed that the majority rated masculinity for themselves and in a same-sex partner as important, and they ideally wished that their behavior was more masculine (Cohen's d=.42) and less feminine (d=.42) than they perceived it to be. Furthermore, one's behavior was more important than how one looks when assessing masculinity. A multiple regression analysis showed that the degree to which they were preoccupied with masculinity and expressed anti-effeminacy accounted for 30\% of the variance in negative feelings about being gay. These finding further support the idea that masculinity is an important construct for gay men and that masculine consciousness and anti-effeminacy are related to negative feelings about being gay.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of people coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV in San Francisco, the San Francisco Department of Public Health's Communicable Disease Control and Prevention Section and the HIV Epidemiology Section collaborated to link their registries. METHODS: In San Francisco, hepatitis reporting is primarily through passive laboratory-based surveillance, and HIV/AIDS reporting is primarily through laboratory-initiated active surveillance. We conducted the registry linkage in 2010 using a sequential algorithm. RESULTS: The registry match included 31,997 HBV-infected people who were reported starting in 1984; 10,121 HCV-infected people who were reported starting in 2001; and 34,551 HIV/AIDS cases reported beginning in 1981. Of the HBV and HCV cases, 6.3\% and 12.6\% were coinfected with HIV, respectively. The majority of cases were white males; however, black people were disproportionately affected. For more than 90\% of the HBV/HIV cases, male-to-male sexual contact (men who have sex with men [MSM]) was the risk factor for HIV infection. Injection drug use was the most frequent risk factor for HIV infection among the HCV/HIV cases; however, 35.6\% of the HCV/HIV coinfected males were MSM but not injection drug users. CONCLUSIONS: By linking the two registries, we found new ways to foster collaborative work and expand our programmatic flexibility. This analysis identified particular populations at risk for coinfection, which can be used by viral hepatitis and HIV screening, prevention, and treatment programs to integrate, enhance, target, and prioritize prevention services and clinical care within the community to maximize health outcomes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the relationship among syndemic conditions (defined as a cluster of interconnected psychosocial health conditions), sexual behaviours and self-reported HIV infection in a global sample of men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: We used generalised estimating equations logistic regression models with robust SEs to assess the relationships among cumulative number of syndemic conditions--including depression, substance use, violence, sexual stigma and homelessness--and unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) and HIV infection, while accounting for clustering within-country in a global cross-sectional survey of 3934 MSM across 151 countries. RESULTS: We observed parallel, significant dose-response associations between the number of syndemic conditions and UAI, as well as number of syndemic conditions and HIV infection. Compared with participants without syndemics, the adjusted OR (aOR) for UAI among those with 1, 2 and 3 or more syndemic conditions were 1.44 (Bonferroni-adjusted 95\% CI 1.23 to 1.68), 1.89 (1.51 to 2.36) and 2.03 (1.43 to 2.89), respectively. Compared with participants without syndemics, the aOR for HIV infection among those with 1, 2 and 3 or more syndemic conditions were 1.67 (1.24 to 2.26), 2.02 (1.44 to 2.85) and 2.35 (1.31 to 4.21), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides evidence of intertwining syndemics that may operate synergistically to increase HIV risk among MSM globally. To curb HIV effectively and advance the health of MSM, multiple conditions must be addressed concurrently using multi-level approaches that target both individual and structural risk factors.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The high prevalence of physical health conditions among sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals could be explained, in part, by SGM individuals' disparate exposure to interconnected psychosocial syndemic risks, including substance use, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, intimate partner violence, and sexual assault. We utilized a syndemic framework to understand the overlapping and potentially synergistic association between psychosocial syndemic risks and physical health conditions among SGM adults. Methods: A sample of 298 self-identified SGM adults (M age = 28.03, SD = 9.86; 47.0\% racial/ethnic minority, 41.6\% transgender or gender nonconforming) completed an online survey from May 2016 through May 2017. Results: Three (1.0\%) participants reported no syndemic risks, 19 (6.4\%) reported one, 52 (17.4\%) reported two, 85 (28.5\%) reported three, 89 (29.9\%) reported four, and 50 (16.8\%) reported all five syndemic risks. The number of psychosocial syndemic risks was positively associated with the number of physical health conditions and synergistically (i.e., more than additively) increased the overall health burden on SGM individuals. Conclusion: We found evidence for psychosocial syndemic risks as predictors of SGM individuals' physical health. This study is novel in providing evidence for syndemics surrounding a comprehensive set of physical health outcomes among individuals identifying along a full spectrum of SGM identities. The study controlled for HIV to examine syndemic conditions surrounding physical health outcomes beyond this well-established syndemically determined condition. Comprehensive intervention and policy efforts that address co-occurring psychosocial risks for physical health conditions are needed to reduce health disparities affecting SGM populations.},

  abstract = {Syndemic theory posits that "syndemic conditions" (e.g., alcohol misuse, polydrug use, suicidality) co-occur among sexual minority men and influence HIV-risk behavior, namely HIV acquisition and transmission risk. To examine how four syndemic conditions cluster among sexual minority men and contribute to HIV-risk behavior, we conducted latent class analysis (LCA) to: (1) classify sexual minority men (n = 937) into subgroups based on their probability of experiencing each syndemic condition; (2) examine the demographic (e.g., race/ethnicity) and social status (e.g., level of socioeconomic distress) characteristics of the most optimally fitting four syndemic classes; (3) examine between-group differences in HIV-risk behavior across classes; and (4) use syndemic class membership to predict HIV-risk behavior with sexual minority men reporting no syndemic conditions as the reference group. The four classes were: (1) no syndemic, (2) alcohol misuse and polydrug use syndemic, (3) polydrug use and HIV syndemic, and (4) alcohol misuse. HIV-risk behavior differed across these latent classes. Demographic and social status characteristics predicted class membership, suggesting that syndemic conditions disproportionately co-occur in vulnerable subpopulations of sexual minority men, such as those experiencing high socioeconomic distress. When predicting HIV-risk behavior, men in the polydrug use and HIV syndemic class were more likely (Adjusted Risk Ratio [ARR] = 2.93, 95\% CI: 1.05, 8.21) and men in the alcohol misuse class were less likely (ARR = 0.17, 95\% CI: 0.07, 0.44) to report HIV-risk behavior than were men in the no syndemic class. LCA represents a promising methodology to inform the development and delivery of tailored interventions targeting distinct combinations of syndemic conditions to reduce sexual minority men's HIV-risk behavior.

  abstract = {Background: The transgender population that uses gender affirmative hormone therapy (GAHT) is rapidly growing. The (side-)effects of GAHT are largely unknown. We examined the effect of GAHT on coagulation parameters associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. Methods: Factor (F)II, FIX, FXI, protein (p)C and free pS, fibrinogen, hematocrit, sex hormonebinding globulin, and normalized activated protein C ratio were measured in 98 transwomen (male sex at birth, female gender identity) and 100 transmen (female sex at birth, male gender identity) before and after 12 months of GAHT (oral or transdermal estradiol and anti-androgens in transwomen, transdermal or intramuscular testosterone in transmen). Mean paired differences in coagulation measurements were estimated with 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI). Differences for route of administration and age were assessed with linear regression. Results: After GAHT, transwomen had more procoagulant profiles with a mean increase in FIX: 9.6 IU/dL (95\%CI 3.1 to 16.0) and FXI: 13.5 IU/dL (95\%CI 9.5 to 17.5), and a decrease in pC: 7.7 IU/dL (95\%CI -10.1 to -5.2). Changes in measures of coagulation were influenced by route of administration (oral vs. transdermal) and age. A higher SHBG level after 12 months was associated with a lower APCr. In transmen, changes were not procoagulant overall and were influenced by age. Differences for route of administration (transdermal vs. intramuscular) were small. Conclusions: GAHT in transmen was not associated with apparent procoagulant changes which provides some reassurance regarding VTE risk. In transwomen GAHT resulted in procoagulant changes, which likely contributes to the observed increased VTE risk.},

  abstract = {Background Anecdotal evidence suggests that men who have sex with men (MSM) are increasingly combining sex and illicit drugs (an activity referred to as `chemsex'), in particular GHB/GBL, ketamine, crystal meth, or mephedrone (here called 4-chems). Use of such drugs has been associated with mental health and sexual health harms. We aim to compare patterns of illicit drug use among MSM in 44 European urban centres. Methods In 2010, EMIS recruited 174,209 men from 38 countries to an anonymous online questionnaire in 25 languages. As harm reduction services for drugs and sex are organised at a local level, we chose to compare cities rather than countries. We defined 44 cities based on region/postal code and settlement size. For multivariable regression analyses, three comparison groups of MSM not living in these cities were applied: MSM living in Germany, the UK, and elsewhere in Europe. Results Data from 55,446 MSM living in 44 urban centres were included. Use of 4-chems (past 4 weeks) was highest in Brighton (16.3\%), Manchester (15.5\%), London (13.2\%), Amsterdam (11.2\%), Barcelona (7.9\%), Zurich (7.0\%) and Berlin (5.3\%). It was lowest in Sofia (0.4\%). The rank order was largely consistent when controlling for age, HIV diagnosis, and number of sexual partners. City of residence was the strongest demographic predictor of chemsex-drug use. Conclusion Use of drugs associated with chemsex among MSM varies substantially across European cities. As city is the strongest predictor of chemsex-drug use, effective harm reduction programmes must include structural as well as individual interventions.},

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are weak bases and have a characteristic `deep' volume of distribution and a half-life of around 50 days. These drugs interfere with lysosomal activity and autophagy{$\mkern1mu$}, interact with membrane stability and alter signalling pathways and transcriptional activity{$\mkern1mu$}, which can result in inhibition of cytokine production and modulation of certain co-s timulatory molecules. These modes of action, together with the drug's chemical properties, might explain the clinical efficacy and well-k nown adverse effects (such as retinopathy) of these drugs. The unknown dose\textendash response relationships of these drugs and the lack of definitions of the minimum dose needed for clinical efficacy and what doses are toxic pose challenges to clinical practice. Further challenges include patient non-a dherence and possible context-d ependent variations in blood drug levels. Available mechanistic data give insights into the immunomodulatory potency of hydroxychloroquine and provide the rationale to search for more potent and/or selective inhibitors.},

This systematic review assesses the effect of educational curricula and training for healthcare students and professionals on LGBT healthcare issues. METHODS: Systematic review; the search terms, strategy and process as well as eligibility criteria were predefined and registered prospectively on PROSPERO. A systematic search of electronic databases was undertaken. Screening for eligible studies and data extraction were done in duplicate. All the eligible studies were assessed for risk of bias. The outcome of interest was a change in participants' knowledge, attitude and or practice. RESULTS: Out of 1171 papers identified, 16 publications reporting 15 studies were included in the review. Three were non-randomized controlled studies and 12 had a pre/post-design; two had qualitative components. Bias was reported in the selection of participants and confounding. Risk reported was moderate/mild. Most studies were from the USA, the topics revolved around key terms and terminology, stigma and discrimination, sexuality and sexual dysfunction, sexual history taking, LGBT-specific health and health disparities. Time allotted for training ranged from 1 to 42 hours, the involvement of LGBT people was minimal. The only intervention in sub-Saharan Africa focused exclusively on men who have sex with men. All the studies reported statistically significant improvement in knowledge, attitude and/or practice post-training. Two main themes were identified from the qualitative studies: the process of changing values and attitudes to be more LGBT inclusive, and the constraints to the application of new values in practice. Conclusions Training of healthcare providers will provide information and improve skills of healthcare providers which may lead to improved quality of healthcare for LGBT people. This review reports short-term improvement in knowledge, attitudes and practice of healthcare students and professionals with regards to sexual and LGBT-specific healthcare. However, a unified conceptual model for training in-terms of duration, content and training methodology was lacking.},

Despite high HIV prevalence (20 \%) among MSM in Tijuana, Mexico, little attention has been paid to the occurrence of sexual violence in this high-risk group. The present study used a syndemic conditions framework to examine correlates of sexual violence victimization in a sample of 201 MSM surveyed in Tijuana, Mexico during 2012 and 2013. Participants were recruited through respondent-driven sampling and underwent a 2-h baseline interview and testing for HIV and syphilis. Sexual violence was defined as any incident during the past year in which the participant had been raped, sexually molested, or sexually harassed. The majority of participants self-identified as gay or bisexual, had never married, were employed, and had a high school education or greater. The average age was 29.7 years. Thirty-nine percent reported sexual violence in the past year. A hierarchical multiple linear regression model predicting more experiences of sexual violence was tested. In a final model, a higher number of experiences of sexual violence was associated with a history of childhood sexual abuse, more adult experiences of homophobia, more depression and hostility symptoms, and not living with a spouse or steady partner. The findings from this study support a model of co-occurring psychosocial factors that increase the likelihood of sexual violence experiences among MSM. Multi-level approaches to the prevention of childhood and adult experiences of sexual violence and homophobia are needed to avert the development of adverse mental and physical health outcomes associated with sexual violence victimization.},

However, objectification theory research has rarely been extended to a uniquely bisexual population. In this study, we qualitatively examined the sexual objectification experiences of 12 bisexual women. The findings revealed that whereas bisexual women reported traditional sexual objectification experiences, they also described these experiences embedded within fetishization of identity, erasure, and antibisexual discrimination. Such findings informed the discriminatory experiences of bisexual women and their coping strategies. This study offers an important addition to the canon and expansion of sexual objectification literature to bisexual adults and suggests the need for greater visibility and understanding of this historically under-represented population.},

Methods Data from 1484 HIV-negative or undiagnosed MSM included in the AURAH study, a cross-sectional, self-completed questionnaire study of 2630 individuals from 20 sexual health clinics in the United Kingdom in 2013\textendash 2014, was analysed. Two measures of recreational drug use in the previous three months were defined; (i) polydrug use (use of 3 or more recreational drugs) and (ii) chemsex drug use (use of mephedrone, crystal methamphetamine or GHB/GBL). Associations of socio-demographic, health and lifestyle factors with drug use, and associations of drug use with sexual behaviour, were investigated. Results Of the 1484 MSM, 350 (23.6\%) reported polydrug use and 324 (21.8\%) reported chemsex drug use in the past three months. Overall 852 (57.5\%) men reported condomless sex in the past three months; 430 (29.0\%) had CLS with {$\geq$}2 partners, 474 (31.9\%) had CLS with unknown/HIV+ partner(s); 187 (12.6\%) had receptive CLS with an unknown status partner. For polydrug use, prevalence ratios (95\% confidence interval) for association with CLS measures, adjusted for socio-demographic factors were: 1.38 (1.26, 1.51) for CLS; 2.11 (1.80, 2.47) for CLS with {$\geq$}2 partners; 1.89 (1.63, 2.19) for CLS with unknown/HIV+ partner(s); 1.36 (1.00, 1.83) for receptive CLS with an unknown status partner. Corresponding adjusted prevalence ratios for chemsex drug use were: 1.38 (1.26, 1.52); 2.07 (1.76, 2.43); 1.88 (1.62, 2.19); 1.49 (1.10, 2.02). Polydrug and chemsex drug use were also strongly associated with previous STI, PEP use, group sex and high number of new sexual partners. Associations remained with little attenuation after further adjustment for depressive symptoms and alcohol intake. Conclusion There was a high prevalence of polydrug use and chemsex drug use among HIV negative MSM attending UK sexual health clinics. Drug use was strongly associated with sexual behaviours linked to risk of acquisition of STIs and HIV.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In an era when HIV transmission has been on the rise among men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender women may play a considerable role in China's current HIV epidemic as a potential "bridge" of HIV transmission between homosexual and heterosexual populations. We sought to understand the risk behaviours and factors associated with HIV infection among transgender women in two cities in China., METHODS: From January to December 2016, we recruited transgender women with the help of community-based organizations (CBOs) through a wide range of methods, including snowball sampling. After recruitment, we asked participants to fill out a structured questionnaire including questions about socio-demographics, sexual behaviours, condom use, substance use and uptake of health care services. HIV infection status was determined by using two different rapid testing reagents., RESULTS: Among 498 subjects enrolled in this study, 233 were from Shanghai and 265 were from Tianjin. The median age was 30 years (range: 18-68; IQR: 24-33). Of them, 337 (67.7\%) preferred feminine dress, 13 (2.6\%) had undergone transsexual operation and 68 (13.7\%) had used hormones for transition purposes. Nearly half (45.6\%) reported having regular partners, and 351 (70.5\%) had casual partners. Regarding condom use, 81.5\% reported not always using condoms with stable partners, and 70.9\% reported not using condoms with casual partners. Twenty-five (5.0\%) had a history of buying sex and fifty-one (10.2\%) had a history of selling sex in the past three months. A total of 200 (40.2\%) participants had used at least one kind of controlled substance in the past six months. The most commonly used substances were amyl nitrates (rush popper) (99.5\%) and 5-MeO-DiPT (20.0\%). Among rush popper users, 170 (85.4\%) reported always having sex while on the drug, and 177 (88.9\%) reported increased sexual pleasure after using the drug. The HIV infection risk factors identified in our study were being located in Shanghai (aOR = 9.35, 95\% CI = 3.89-22.49), selling sex in the past three months (aOR = 3.44, 95\% CI = 1.31-9.01), and substance use in the past six months (aOR = 5.71, 95\% CI = 2.63-12.41)., CONCLUSIONS: Transgender women bear a high HIV burden in the two Chinese cities. Those involved in commercial sex tended to have inconsistent condom use, leading to high risk of HIV infection. Substance use was an independent risk factor of HIV infection by increasing sexual activities and unprotected sex, which indicated an aggravated and complex situation with possible interacting syndemic factors that could cumulatively facilitate sexual risk behaviours and HIV infection in transgender women. There is an urgent need for innovative and appropriate HIV prevention programmes targeting this unique population. Efforts should be made to provide them with tailored services including persuasive communication on consistent condom use, substance use counselling and related referral services, all with the goal of reducing HIV epidemic among transgender women.},

Past studies tend to group LGBQ youth together; however, more recent studies suggest subtle differences in risk between sexual minority groups. This study examined differences in mental health symptoms across male and female youth who are attracted to the same sex (gay and lesbian), opposite sex (heterosexual), both sexes (bisexual), or are unsure of whom they were attracted to (questioning) in a sample of 2,513 youth (ages 14???24 years). Methods Data were collected using the Behavioral Health Screen???a Web-based screening tool that assesses psychiatric symptoms and risk behaviors???during routine well visits. Results Bisexual and questioning females endorsed significantly higher scores on the depression, anxiety, and traumatic distress subscales than did heterosexual females. Lesbians, bisexual females, and questioning females all exhibited significantly higher lifetime suicide scores than heterosexual females. Interestingly, bisexual females exhibited the highest current suicide scores. Gay and bisexual males endorsed significantly higher scores on the depression and traumatic distress subscales than did heterosexual males. Gay males also exhibited higher scores on the anxiety subscale than heterosexual males, with bisexual males exhibiting a nonsignificant trend toward higher scores as well. Conclusions Findings highlight varying level of risk across subgroups of LGBQ youth and suggest the importance of considering LGBQ groups separately in the context of a behavioral health assessment, especially for females.},

These arise both from the social nature of STD transmission and from inherent difficulties in collecting accurate and informative data on exposure and infection. Risk of acquiring an STD depends on both individual-level factors and the behavior and infectiousness of others. Consequently, study designs and analysis methods developed for studying chronic disease risk in individuals or groups may not apply directly. Simple models of STD transmission were used to investigate these issues, focusing on how the interplay between individual- and population-level factors influences design and interpretation of epidemiologic studies, with particular attention to interpretation of common measures of association and to common sources of bias in epidemiologic data. Existing methods for investigating risk factors can be modified such that these issues may be addressed directly.},

Overall, 41.8 percent of FTM participants reported verbal harassment, physical assault, or denial of equal treatment in a doctor's office or hospital. When other factors were controlled, being Native American or multiracial, identifying as queer or asexual/other, having a graduate degree, living full-time as nonbirth gender, using hormones or surgery for medical transition, and having identification documents that list one's preferred gender were associated with increased reporting of health care discrimination experiences; being 45 years or older and reporting an annual income of \$60,000 or more were associated with decreased risk. The study's findings can be useful to social workers, who play a role in educating health care providers and advocating for policies that improve health care experiences for FTM and other transgender patients.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Syndemics framework describes two or more co-occurring epidemics which synergistically interact with each other and the complex structural social forces that sustain them leading to excess disease burden. The term syndemic was first used to describe the interaction between substance abuse, violence, and AIDS by Merrill Singer. A broader range of syndemic studies have since emerged describing the framework's applicability to other public health scenarios. With syndemic theory garnering significant attention, the focus is shifting towards developing robust empirical approaches. Unfortunately, the complex nature of the disease-disease interactions nested within several social drivers complicates empirical analyses. In answering the call to analyze syndemics at the population level, we propose the use of spatial epidemiology as an empirical framework for syndemics research.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Spatial epidemiology, which typically relies on geographic information systems (GIS) and statistics, is the discipline that studies such spatial variations, to understand the geographic landscape and the risk environment within which disease epidemics occur. GIS maps provide visualization aids to investigate the spatial distribution of disease outcomes, the associated social factors, and environmental exposures. Analytical inference, such as estimation of disease risks and identification of spatial disease clusters, can provide a detailed statistical view of spatial distributions of diseases. Spatial and spatiotemporal models can help us to understand, measure, and analyze disease syndemics as well as the social, biological, and structural factors associated with them in space and time.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}In this paper, we present a background on syndemics, and spatial epidemiological theory and practice. We present a case study on the HIV and HCV syndemic in West Virginia, to provide an example of the use of GIS and spatial analytical methods.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) substantially diminishes the likelihood of HIV acquisition, poor adherence can decrease the HIV-protective benefits of PrEP. The present investigation sought to identify the extent to which alcohol consumption, substance use, and depression were linked to PrEP nonadherence among gay, bisexual, and other men-who-have-sex-with-men (gbMSM)., METHODS: gbMSM (age {$>$}= 18, prescribed PrEP for {$>$}=3 months) were recruited from two clinics in Toronto, Canada for an e-survey assessing demographics; PrEP nonadherence (4-day PrEP-focused ACTG assessment); hazardous and harmful alcohol use (AUDIT scores of 8-15 and 16+, respectively); moderate/high risk substance use (NIDA M-ASSIST scores {$>$} 4); depression (CESD-10 scores {$>$}=10); and other PrEP-relevant factors. The primary outcome, PrEP nonadherence, entailed missing one or more PrEP doses over the past 4 days. A linear-by-linear test of association assessed whether increasing severity of alcohol use (i.e., based on AUDIT categories) was linked to a greater occurrence of PrEP nonadherence. Univariate logistic regression was employed to determine factors associated with PrEP nonadherence, and factors demonstrating univariate associations at the p {$<$} .10 significance level were included in a multivariate logistic regression model. Additive and interactive effects involving key significant factors were assessed through logistic regression to evaluate potential syndemic-focused associations., RESULTS: A total of 141 gbMSM (Mean age = 37.9, white = 63.1\%) completed the e-survey. Hazardous/harmful drinking (31.9\%), moderate/high risk substance use (43.3\%), and depression (23.7\%) were common; and one in five participants (19.9\%) reported PrEP nonadherence. Increasing alcohol use level was significantly associated with a greater likelihood of nonadherence (i.e., 15.6, 25.0, and 44.4\% of low-risk, hazardous, and harmful drinkers reported nonadherence, respectively (chi2(1) = 4.79, p = .029)). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that harmful alcohol use (AOR = 6.72, 95\%CI = 1.49-30.33, p = .013) and moderate/high risk cocaine use (AOR = 3.11, 95\%CI = 1.01-9.59, p = .049) independently predicted nonadherence. Furthermore, an additive association emerged, wherein the likelihood of PrEP nonadherence was highest among those who were hazardous/harmful drinkers and moderate/high risk cocaine users (OR = 2.25, 95\%CI = 1.19-4.25, p = .013). Depression was not associated with nonadherence., CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the need to integrate alcohol- and substance-focused initiatives into PrEP care for gbMSM. Such initiatives, in turn, may help improve PrEP adherence and reduce the potential for HIV acquisition among this group.},

In 2018, the Director-General of WHO announced a call to action for the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. WHO has called for global action to scale-up vaccination, screening, and treatment of precancer, early detection and prompt treatment of early invasive cancers, and palliative care. An elimination threshold in terms of cervical cancer incidence has not yet been defined, but an absolute rate of cervical cancer incidence could be chosen for such a threshold. In this study, we aimed to quantify the potential cumulative effect of scaled up global vaccination and screening coverage on the number of cervical cancer cases averted over the 50 years from 2020 to 2069, and to predict outcomes beyond 2070 to identify the earliest years by which cervical cancer rates could drop below two absolute levels that could be considered as possible elimination thresholds-the rare cancer threshold (six new cases per 100 000 women per year, which has been observed in only a few countries), and a lower threshold of four new cases per 100 000 women per year.},

  abstract = {The syndemics model of health focuses on the biosocial complex, which consists of interacting, co-present, or sequential diseases and the social and environmental factors that promote and enhance the negative effects of disease interaction. This emergent approach to health conception and clinical practice reconfigures conventional historical understanding of diseases as distinct entities in nature, separate from other diseases and independent of the social contexts in which they are found. Rather, all of these factors tend to interact synergistically in various and consequential ways, having a substantial impact on the health of individuals and whole populations. Specifically, a syndemics approach examines why certain diseases cluster (ie, multiple diseases affecting individuals and groups); the pathways through which they interact biologically in individuals and within populations, and thereby multiply their overall disease burden, and the ways in which social environments, especially conditions of social inequality and injustice, contribute to disease clustering and interaction as well as to vulnerability. In this Series, the contributions of the syndemics approach for understanding both interacting chronic diseases in social context, and the implications of a syndemics orientation to the issue of health rights, are examined.},

The theory has been widely applied in the fields of medicine, public health and anthropology, but how the concept is conceptualised and investigated in new syndemics literature remains unclear. This paper offers a scoping review of recent syndemics literature aiming to address the question: Where have scholars taken the syndemics concept? Five bibliographic databases were searched for titles containing 'syndemic[s]' revealing 334 records. A total of 143 journal articles, 23 book chapters, 21 commentaries, 2 books and 5 dissertations were assessed. Citations were classified into five categories: syndemics (n = 22), potential syndemics (n = 34), socially determined heightened burden of disease (n = 29), harmful disease cluster (n = 32) and additive adverse conditions (n = 71). The limited number of citations meeting the definition of a syndemic arrangement highlights the challenges related to describing and empirically supporting the biological\textendash biological and biological\textendash social relationships. Nevertheless, there is value in retaining the original, holistic, biosocial meaning of syndemics to identify and detail the casual pathways and mechanisms of interactions.},

Synthetic analysis of our prior research on internet gaming and health affirms how social factors and mental and physical wellness mutually condition each other in this online play context. Employing biocultural anthropological mixed methods, we focus on statistical interactions between intensive gaming and social well-being in relation to genomic markers of immune function. We show that among gamers with low social well-being, intensive game play is associated with compromised immunity markers, but among those with robust social connection, that same play correlates with decreased activation of stress-related immunity activation. The apparently {$<$}em{$>$}beneficial{$<$}/em{$>$} interaction of higher social well-being and intensive game play resonates with an emerging body of research showing how positive practices\textemdash in this case, engaged and pleasurable videogame play\textemdash can increase resilience to the negative linked psychological and genomic responses to precarity. Based on these findings, we argue, in relation to gaming behaviors, a syndemics analysis could usefully be expanded by attending to both sides of the synergistic interaction between two social conditions: not just exacerbation of dysfunction in relation to their combined effect, but also non-additive {$<$}em{$>$}enhancement{$<$}/em{$>$} of health that may stem from such combinations. We draw on literature emphasizing the relevance to health of "eudaimonic" well-being\textemdash psychosocial processes that transcend immediate self-gratification and involve the pursuit of meaningful and pro-social goals. On that basis, we propose the term "syndaimonics" to capture synergies between social context and mental flourishing, which, in this context and presumably others, can illuminate sources of health resilience and overall improved psychosocial wellbeing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The current analysis examines sex party attendance and behavior in a sample of 540 emergent adult gay, bisexual, and other YMSM in New York City, ages 18-29 years. Findings indicate that 8.7\% (n = 47) of the sample had attended a sex party 3 months prior to assessment. Sex party attendees reported that parties included both HIV-positive and HIV-negative men; attendees also reported unprotected sex and limited access to condoms and lubricant. As compared with those who did not attend sex parties, those who did indicated significantly more lifetime and recent (last 3 months) casual sex partners, drug use (both number of different drugs used and total lifetime use), psychosocial burden (history of partner violence and number of arrests), and total syndemic burden (a composite of unprotected anal sex, drug use and psychosocial burden). These results indicate that while only a small percentage of the overall sample attended sex parties, the intersection of both individual risk factors coupled with risk factors engendered within the sex party environment itself has the potential to be a catalyst in the proliferation of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in urban settings. Lastly, given that sex parties are different than other sex environments, commercial and public, with regard to how they are accessed, public health strategies may need to become more tailored in order to reach this potentially highly risky group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For transgender individuals taking hormone therapy (HT), data on laboratory values are limited, and the effects on laboratory values cannot be easily predicted. We evaluated the impact on common laboratory analytes in transgender individuals before and after initiation of HT. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of transgender patients identified at transgender-specific clinics at an urban county hospital and community clinic. Laboratory data were collected on hormone concentrations, hematologic parameters, electrolytes, lipids, and liver and renal markers before and after initiation of HT. RESULTS: We identified 183 transgender women (TW) and 119 transgender men (TM) for whom laboratory data were available. In all, 87 TW and 62 TM had baseline laboratory data, and data were also available for 133 TW and 89 TM on HT for Ͼ6 months. The most significant changes were seen in red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and creatinine levels after Ͼ6 months of HT, which increased in TM and decreased in TW after HT (P Ͻ 0.005; d index Ͼ 0.6). Alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels increased in TM; however, the effect size was small (d index Ͻ 0.5). Calcium, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase levels significantly decreased in TW (P Ͻ 0.001; d Ͼ 0.6). Additionally, TM were found to have increased triglycerides and decreased HDL levels (P Ͻ 0.005; d Ͼ 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Changes occur in several common laboratory parameters for patients on HT. Some laboratory values changed to match the gender identity, whereas others remained unchanged or were intermediate from the baseline values. These findings will help guide interpretation of laboratory test results in transgender patients taking HT.},

A network model of psychopathology assumes that observable features of disorders directly interact, and network analytic methods quantify how central each feature is. We conducted a network analysis of core deficits of BPD features using a large (n = 4386) sample of participants with a range of BPD features. The most central features of participants in the High BPD group were loneliness, recklessness/impulsivity, and intense moods, supporting models of emotion dysregulation and interpersonal problems. The networks of BPD features did not differ between men and women. We provide directions for future research to enhance our understanding of how networks of BPD features change over time.},

CONCLUSIONS AIDS prevention among MSM has overwhelmingly focused on sexual risk alone. Other health problems among MSM not only are important in their own right, but also may interact to increase HIV risk.

The theory takes a life course perspective on the development of health problems among gay men, and describes the development of these problems as a syndemic process of interacting health problems that begin at an early age among gay male adolescents. The current dominant explanations for lower health profiles among gay men are that homophobia causes poor health in men. This chapter adds to that explanation the possibility that the lifelong effects of experiencing homophobic violence and cultural marginalization at a very early age is a centrally-important force in syndemic production among gay men. \textcopyright{} 2008 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

Previous studies have examined five syndemic indicators (polydrug use, depression, childhood sexual abuse, sexual compulsivity, and intimate partner violence). Many of these studies have utilized sum scores, the total number of syndemic factors endorsed, to quantify syndemic stress. This approach assumes a unidimensional latent factor and equivalence of factor loadings. It also overlooks the possibility that patterns, or classes, of syndemic factor endorsement may be present. The current study utilized survey data from 669 gay and bisexual men to test assumptions of unidimensionality and factor loading equivalence and to examine the utility of identifying latent classes of syndemic stress. Analysis supported operationalizing syndemics as a unidimensional latent factor. Assumptions of loading equality were not supported. Meaningful profiles of syndemic stress were not evident in latent class analysis results.},

Participants completed measures of five syndemic factors (depression, poly-drug use, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and sexual compulsivity). They also reported on whether condoms were used during first intercourse together and the timing of first condomless anal intercourse (CAI) relative to HIV disclosure in their relationship. Results of binary logistic regression analyses supported the hypothesis that the sum of partners' syndemic stress was negatively associated with condom use at first intercourse and with HIV disclosure prior to first CAI. Syndemic stress may contribute to HIV transmission risk between main partners in part because it accelerates the progression to CAI and interferes with communication processes central to harm reduction strategies utilized by gay men in relationships. Implications for prevention strategies and couples interventions, such as couples HIV counseling and testing, that facilitate communication skill-building, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Chemsex is a growing public health concern in urban centres, and few interventions exist to mitigate the significant sexual, drug-related, and social harms potentially experienced by people who participate in chemsex. In much of the world, these immediate harms are further compounded by the criminalisation and stigmatisation of both homosexuality and drug use, preventing participants fully engaging with treatment services or provision of health care. Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men participating in chemsex fall between the traditional definitions of key populations and consequently are poorly provided for by existing drug and sexual health frameworks. Aetiologically complex issues such as chemsex require multifaceted interventions that may fall outside conventional frameworks. Existing interventions have been designed and implemented at the local level. The use of international policy to mitigate these structural barriers, however, has largely been ignored. International policy is broad in nature and its implementation is, in principle, binding for member states. We believe that despite its low international prevalence, international policy can be of use in improving the lives of people who participate in chemsex. Through stimulating a much-needed debate on the interplay between sex and drugs within global health and harm reduction frameworks, this paper aims to address the paucity of substantial discussion surrounding the applicability of international language to chemsex. We analyse international policy aimed at addressing HIV, illicit drugs, harm reduction, and development, and make recommendations for both national advocacy, and advocates working to alter the positions of member states internationally.},

  abstract = {Previous behavioral research has shown that young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at increased risk for substance abuse, mental health burden, and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). As informed by syndemic theory this analysis sought to further delineate the impact of compulsivity in sexual risk-taking behavior among a new generation of YMSM ages 18-19. Because of the associations found between compulsive sexual behavior, sexually transmitted infections, and alcohol/drug abuse, it is paramount that an examination of compulsive sexual behavior and the associated risk factors for sexual risk-taking is extended to YMSM. The current analysis administered the Compulsive Sexual Behavior Inventory (CSBI) as well as additional psychological, psychosocial, alcohol/drug using, and sexual behavior measures to 509 diverse, confirmed HIV-negative, YMSM from the New York City metropolitan area. An exploratory factor analysis was undertaken to assess the underlying factor structure of the CSBI among this sample of YMSM. This was followed by a moderation analysis exploring the influence of depression on the relation between compulsive sexual behavior and sexual risk-taking. Finally, a multivariable model was tested to determine whether the use of alcohol and drugs mediated the relation between compulsive sexual behavior and sexual risk-taking. Results indicate that the same psychometric factor structure emerged among YMSM as previous analyses have demonstrated among adults. Depression was shown to significantly moderate the relation between compulsive sexual behavior and sexual risk-taking, where higher rates of depression were associated with significantly more unprotected anal sex among those YMSM who scored high in sexual compulsivity. Alcohol and drug use were shown to significantly and completely mediate the relation between compulsive sexual behavior and unprotected anal sex. Findings suggest that compulsive sexual behavior in concert with depressive symptoms and substance use exacerbate risk for sexual risk-taking among YMSM. Clinicians must take a holistic approach when conducting behavioral interventions and address the underlying psychological symptoms along with problematic behaviors in order to reduce HIV-risk among this vulnerable population.

  abstract = {The prevalence of cigarette smoking among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) is significantly higher than among their heterosexual peers. We undertook an analysis to examine cigarette smoking in relation to demographic factors and other risk behaviors among 580 YMSM, ages 13-29, in New York City. Cross-sectional data were collected as part of larger study of risk behaviors using palm devices and targeted active recruitment strategies across all five boroughs of the city. Multivariate modeling suggests that Asian or Pacific Islander and White YMSM are more likely to report cigarette smoking than other racial and ethnic groups, as are men reporting a middle class socioeconomic status. In addition, smoking was related to the likelihood of using a variety of illicit substances, as well as alcohol and pharmaceuticals without a prescription, during the period of assessment. YMSM who smoke cigarettes reported a greater number of casual sex partners and a greater number of transactional sex partners than non-smokers. Episodic analysis of sexual behaviors with casual partners indicated that smokers were more likely to engage in illicit drug and alcohol use immediately before or during sex than did non-smokers. These findings are understood as part of a larger syndemic among YMSM, and suggest that smoking prevention and cessation programs should be embedded as part of larger more holistic health and wellness programs targeting YMSM.},

  abstract = {Young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at increased likelihood of experiencing depression and engaging in condomless sexual behaviors. The goal of the current investigation was to examine the relationship between negative mood and compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) and to assess for their individual and combined influence on sexual risk-taking behavior among a diverse sample of YMSM in New York City (the P18 Cohort Study). We first analyzed sociodemographic, depressive symptoms, CSB, and sexual risk-taking from the cross-sectional data of 509, 18- or 19-year-old YMSM recruited using non-probability sampling. We found a significant positive correlation between CSB and depression and between CSB and frequency of condomless anal sex acts reported over the last 30 days. Multivariate results found that the presence of both depression and CSB contributed to elevated sexual risk-taking among these urban YMSM. Clinical implications include the importance of assessing for CSB when depression is present and vice versa in order to improve HIV prevention. Informed by minority stress theory and syndemic theory, our results suggest that interventions focused on the health of YMSM recognize that mental health and social context all interact to increase physical health vulnerability vis-a-vis sexual behaviors, depression, and CSB. Thus, HIV prevention and intervention programs need to incorporate mental health components and services that address these needs.},

  abstract = {Background/introduction With much speculation and anecdotal reports regarding the causal links between sexualised recreational drug use by MSM (commonly referred to as 'ChemSex') and HIV/HCV rates, there has been much demand from commissioners and researchers and practitioners to identify the extent of the problem. In 2014, one London GUM/HIV clinic launched the NHS' first targeted ChemSex clinic. This presentation includes robust data collected from 874 unique presentations in the first year of this landmark clinic. Aim(s)/objectives The objective was to satisfy the health sector's concerns about the extent of this much hyped syndemic, with qualitative and quantitative data as well as assess interventions and cohort engagement methods. Methods Targeted clinics and outreach services were established with skilled addiction staff and resourcing peer volunteers, collecting culturally and contextually appropriate behavioural trends and data. Results Data includes: * Effectiveness of certain contextually-appropriate questions re ChemSex during GUM consultation. * ARV non-adherence amongst high-risk ChemSex party-goers who favour condomless sex. * Condom use (or otherwise) and number of partners broken down to include HIV+ve MSM not on treatment. * HIV/HCV broken down to include sexual acquisition versus injecting drug use acquisition. * HCV data broken down to include number of re-infections amongst HIV-ve non-injecting drug users. Discussion/conclusion This presentation includes the data, offers examples of how this model might be adapted in other services, and incorporates some training for attendees in how to overcome fears or ignorance regarding drug use risk assessments and consultations; it also includes film footage of role play exercises for skill-building purposes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Substance use is prevalent among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and may be associated with intimate partner violence (IPV). Experiences of IPV are associated with several adverse health conditions among adult MSM, but there is a gap in knowledge about this relationship among YMSM, which warrants further investigation., METHODS: This study employs baseline data from a prospective cohort study to examine lifetime experiences of IPV in relation to substance use in the previous 30 days among n=528 YMSM in New York City from 2009 to 2011. To examine the extent to which IPV (any experiences, victimization, and perpetration) are related to substance use (alcohol, marijuana, stimulant, and other drugs) in the last 30 days, distinct 2-step multinomial logistic regression models, controlling for sociodemographic differences, were constructed., RESULTS: 44.3\% reported lifetime IPV experience, with 39.2\% of reporting victimization and 30.5\% reporting perpetration. IPV is associated with a 1.6 increased odds of 2 or more instances of alcohol use, a 1.6-1.8 increased odds of 2 or more instances of marijuana use, a 1.8-2.5 increased odds of 2 or more instances of stimulant use, and a 4.1-6.1 increased odds of 2 or more instances of other substance use., CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the strong association between IPV and increased frequency of substance use among YMSM and provide support that violence may exist as part of a syndemic facing YMSM. Prevention and intervention strategies may be improved by addressing substance use in the context of IPV and other related health challenges. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

  title = {Intimate Partner Violence among Young Men Who Have Sex with Men.},
  author = {Stults, Christopher B},
  address = {{US}},
  abstract = {There is a growing body of literature indicating that intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious health issue among young gay, bisexual, and other young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Although existing research indicates that IPV is associated with a range of mental and physical heath problems in other populations, the literature regarding IPV among YMSM is limited in several important ways. Specifically, few studies have investigated the prevalence, correlates, and health-risk behaviors associated with IPV among YMSM, and none have examined factors associated with IPV longitudinally. To address these gaps in the literature, three analyses were undertaken, using data from an ongoing prospective cohort study of (N = 600) YMSM in New York City, yielding three manuscripts. The first manuscript reports that 39.2\% of YMSM report lifetime IPV victimization, 30.5\% report perpetration, and 25.4\% report both. Childhood mistreatment, impulsivity, gay-related stigma, and PTSD were also related to IPV. The second manuscript provides evidence that both victimization and perpetration are associated with heightened levels of substance use, particularly alcohol, marijuana, and stimulant use. The third manuscript reports on longitudinal determinants of IPV among YMSM. The paper reports that early experiences of IPV are the most robust predictor of future experiences of IPV, and that relationship status, gay-related stigma, depression, marijuana use, and other illicit substance use are associated with IPV over time. In its entirety, this body of work utilized an integrated theoretical model that combines key elements of social learning theory, with a theory of syndemics, to examine IPV among YMSM. Taken together, these findings suggest that IPV prevention programs should aim to reach YMSM before their first experiences of relationship violence, as these early experiences are strongly linked to later experiences of IPV. Also, IPV interventions should be modified to meet the needs of YMSM and should target impulsivity, depression, gay-related stigma, and substance use behaviors. Additionally, substance use interventions may be improved by addressing IPV. Finally, policymakers should enact policies that improve the social climate for LGBTQ people, such as anti-discrimination and hate crime laws, in order to stem violence against and among YMSM.

  abstract = {Research indicates that experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) are common among young gay, bisexual, and other young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Yet, there is little understanding of the individual, mental health, and psychosocial variables associated with IPV in this population. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence and correlates of IPV among a new generation of racially/ethnically diverse YMSM. Baseline data from a longitudinal cohort study of YMSM (n = 598) from New York City informed lifetime experiences of IPV victimization, perpetration, and mutual IPV (those reporting both victimization and perpetration). Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to examine associations between IPV and individual, mental health, and psychosocial factors. Among YMSM, 39\% reported IPV victimization, 31\% reported perpetration, and 25\% reported mutual IPV. Victimization and perpetration were highly correlated. Childhood mistreatment was related to all 3 IPV outcomes. With regard to psychosocial states, impulsivity was the only variable strongly related to all 3 IPV outcomes. PTSD was significantly related to IPV victimization but not IPV perpetration. In addition, personal gay-related stigma was associated with IPV victimization, whereas public gay-related stigma was associated with IPV perpetration. Findings extend previous research by identifying psychosocial and mental health variables associated with IPV, while controlling for childhood mistreatment. We recommend more systematic screening for IPV in health care settings that serve YMSM (e.g., HIV testing sites). Moreover, we suggest that IPV may be part of a larger syndemic disproportionately burdening YMSM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of this change in donor screening criteria on the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic among blood donors in Italy.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the data obtained from the Italian blood donor epidemiological surveillance system. We compared data collected in 2009 and 2010, when the individual risk assessment policy was applied, with data collected in 1999 when permanent deferral was applied for men who have sex with men based on a declaration of sexual orientation. We evaluated the change over time in the relative proportion of HIV antibody-positive donors who likely acquired the infection from men who have sex with men vs heterosexual sexual exposure; the relative risk was calculated using 1999 as the reference year.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: In all 3 years, the majority of HIV antibody-positive donors reported sexual exposure as a risk factor for HIV infection; this proportion increased over time, although not statistically significantly. Heterosexuals always accounted for at least 40\% of all HIV antibody-positive cases. The rate of HIV antibody-positive donors increased similarly in men who have sex with men and heterosexuals; specifically, the rate of HIV antibody-positive cases per 100,000 donors was more than 2-fold higher among men who have sex with men in 2009-2010 than in 1999 (2009-2010 vs 1999, RR =2.8; P =0.06), and that among heterosexuals was 1.5 fold higher (P =0.18).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nDISCUSSION: When comparing the period before (1999) and after (2009-2010), the implementation of the individual risk assessment policy in 2001, no significant increase in the proportion of men who have sex with men compared to heterosexuals was observed among HIV antibody-positive blood donors, suggesting that the change in donor deferral policy did not lead to a disproportionate increase of HIV-seropositive men who have sex with men.},

To better understand the evolving landscape of PrEP uptake in this at-risk population, we sought to examine psychosocial factors associated with PrEP uptake in a sample of BMSM residing in the Atlanta, GA, area.MethodBMSM were recruited through online social media, LGBT venues, and participant referral, and self-reported demographic and psychosocial information via computer-assisted self-interview. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine psychosocial factors associated with PrEP uptake.ResultsIn 293 BMSM, most (N = 260; 88.7\%) reported awareness of PrEP yet few (N = 30; 10.1\%) reported ever having taken PrEP. BMSM reporting more syndemic conditions were less likely to be current PrEP users (OR = 0.59; 95\% CI: 0.36, 0.96). BMSM reporting recent condomless anal sex (CAS) with a partner met online (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.53; 95\% CI: 1.07, 5.93), or who reported having chlamydia (aOR = 8.21; 95\% CI: 1.42, 47.67) or STI-related symptoms (aOR = 4.35; 95\% CI: 1.32, 14.37) in the past 3 months, or genital warts in their lifetime (aOR = 7.74; 95\% CI: 2.47, 24.21) were more likely to have ever used PrEP. Sexual orientation stigma from health care providers was negatively associated with PrEP uptake (OR = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.68, 0.95) among BMSM reporting recent CAS and multiple partners.ConclusionSyndemic and stigma theories may inform strategies for improving PrEP uptake in BMSM.

  abstract = {Transgender (TG) individuals have higher rates of mortality associated with cancer diagnoses, in part due to avoidance of gender-assigned cancer screenings resulting in later stages at diagnosis. Knowledge about the risks of breast or gynecological cancer in TG and nonbinary (NB) persons receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy is limited. Even less information exists regarding the subset of individuals with genetic predisposition for these malignancies. We performed a retrospective literature review of studies from the last 15~years on breast cancer rates and identified risks in TG persons. An accumulating body of data on breast cancer incidence in TG persons suggests higher than previously believed rates of breast cancer in TG women compared with cisgender men and risk correlating with duration of hormone use. Few studies have examined other cancer risks in TG populations. To date, only three publications address the association with \emph{BRCA1/2} mutation presence and breast cancer incidence in TG persons. Meanwhile, there is growing awareness and social acceptance of TG/NB identities coupled with recognition of gender dysphoria at increasingly earlier ages. No information directly addressing cancer risk counseling in TG/NB adolescents and young adults with a family history of cancer or hereditary cancer syndrome exists. Whether the presence of a known genetic predisposition or strong family cancer history may affect cancer risk in these populations is unknown, leading to significant gaps in clinicians' ability to accurately and appropriately estimate cancer risks and counsel those with genetic predisposition on the risks/benefits associated with surgical options and the initiation, duration, and dosing of gender-affirming hormone therapies. A series of three cases illustrates the utility of cancer risk assessment and genetic testing in TG/NB adolescents and young adults, and the unique challenges and unanswered questions that are encountered in the process.},

In this paper, we push scholarship on ecosyndemics into new territory by using the ecosyndemic framework to compare two case studies\textemdash the Southern Interoceanic highway in Peru and the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in Brazil\textemdash to assess the likelihood of socio-environmental factors interacting and leading to ill health in a syndemic fashion. Assessing these two case studies using an ecosyndemic perspective, we find that the construction of dams and highways in tropical forests may create the conditions for increases in vector-borne illnesses (VBIs), such as dengue and malaria, surges in sex work and sexually-transmitted infections (STIs), and increased psychological stress resulting from violence, delinquency, and the erosion of social cohesion - that could interact synergistically to increase an individual's immune burden and a population's overall morbidity. However, we find differences in the impacts of the Interoceanic highway and the Belo Monte dam on food, water, and cultural systems, and observed that community and corporate-level actions may bolster health in the face of rapid socio-ecological change. Looking at the case studies together, a complex picture of vulnerability and resilience, risk and opportunity, complicates straight-forward predictions of ecosyndemic interactions resulting from these development projects but highlights the role that the ecosyndemic concept can play in informing health impact assessments and future research. We conclude by proposing a conceptual model of the potential interactions between psychological stress, VBIs, and STIs and suggest that future investigations of synergistic interactions among these factors draw from the biological, social, and ecological sciences to combine quantitative indicators of disease risk with qualitative methods that prioritize the voices of the people most affected by these projects.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: Sexualised substance use, or `chemsex' has been shown to be a major factor driving the syndemic of HIV/AIDS in communities of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) around the world. However, there is a paucity of research on chemsex among GBMSM in Singapore due to punitive drug laws and the criminalisation of sexual behaviour between men. This qualitative descriptive study is the first to explore perceptions towards, motivators to engaging in, and the barriers to addressing the harms associated with chemsex among GBMSM in Singapore. Methods: We conducted 30 semi-structured in-depth interviews with self-identifying GBMSM between the ages of 18\textendash 39 in Singapore following a purposive sampling strategy. Interview topics included participants' perceptions of drug use among GBMSM in Singapore, perceptions towards chemsex, reasons for drug use and chemsex, and recommendations to address the harms associated with chemsex in Singapore. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants reported that it was common to encounter chemsex among GBMSM in Singapore as it could be easily accessed or initiated using social networking phone apps. Enhancement and prolongation of sexual experiences, fear of rejection from sexual partners and peers, and its use as a means of coping with societal rejection were three main reasons cited for engaging in chemsex. The impact of punitive drug laws on disclosure and stigmatisation of GBMSM who use drugs were reported to be key barriers towards addressing chemsex. Participants suggested using gay-specific commercial venues as avenues for awareness and educational campaigns, and social media to reach out to younger GBMSM. Conclusions: This study highlights the complexities behind chemsex use among GBMSM in Singapore, and the range of individual to institutional factors to be addressed. We recommend that community-based organisations and policy-makers find ways to destigmatise discussion of chemsex and provide safe spaces to seek help for drug use.},

They often seek hormone therapy, with or without surgery, to improve their gender dysphoria and to better align their physical and psychological features with a more feminine gender role. Some of the desired physical changes from oestrogen and anti-androgen therapy include decreased body and facial hair, decreased muscle mass, breast growth, and redistribution of fat. Overall the risks of treatment are low, but include thromboembolism, the risk of which depends on the dose and route of oestrogen administration. Other associated conditions commonly seen in transgender women include increased risks of depression and osteoporosis. The risk of hormone-sensitive cancer seems to be low in transgender women, with no increased risk of breast cancer compared with women and no increase in prostate cancer when compared with men. The evidence base for the care of transgender women is limited by the paucity of high-quality research, and long-term longitudinal studies are needed to inform future guidelines.},

The effect of such events on relief tends to persist for long periods of time and affects the future development of such systems. This paper focuses on changes in middle mountain valleys associated with an extreme hydro-geomorphological event that occurred in the Western Tatra Mountains (Polish Carpathian Mountains) in June of 2007. The geomorphological effects were mapped and an analysis of valley-bottom deposits and dendro-geomorphological data on tree roots and stems was used to identify patterns in the geomorphological transformation taking place during such events. In addition, the organic material obtained from fans was dated by means of carbon-14 dating. The effects of previous extreme events in the study area and their geomorphological outcomes were compared. Four main valley section types were identified in the valley longitudinal profile. Unevenly aged (from 14C 390. {$\pm$}. 30. years YBP (1441-1631. cal. AD) to 14C 3760. {$\pm$}. 70 YBP (4318-3962. cal BP)) organic material was revealed at different depths of each studied fan. A complex structure with alternating layers of fine and coarse material from the analysed fans was identified. The colluvial-alluvial structure of fans suggests that extreme high-energy events did occur more than once per century during the Holocene. This type of fan structure can be referred to as a patchwork. In the study area, rainfall with high energy potential occurs once in every 6-9 years and extreme hydro-geomorphological events occur every 15. years. This type of extreme event may not be exceptional in the history of middle mountain areas. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The syndemic index significantly increased the odds of CAS, GS, and HIV-infection, and these effects were moderated by network characteristics. Network JSI buffered the effect on CAS, romantic network members buffered the effect on GS, and network age and proportion of family network members buffered the effect on HIV-infection. The proportion of friend network members augmented the effect on GS and HIV-infection. Future research to prevent HIV among YBTM should consider social network approaches that target both structural and psychosocial syndemic factors.},

  abstract = {Background: It has been widely suggested that over 80\% of transgender children will come to identify as cisgender (i.e., desist) as they mature, with the assumption that for this 80\%, the trans identity was a temporary ``phase.'' This statistic is used as the scientific rationale for discouraging social transition for pre-pubertal children. This article is a critical commentary on the limitations of this research and a caution against using these studies to develop care recommendations for gender-nonconforming children. Methods: A critical review methodology is employed to systematically interpret four frequentlycited studies that sought to document identity outcomes for gender-nonconforming children (often referred to as ``desistance'' research). Results: Methodological, theoretical, ethical, and interpretive concerns regarding four ``desistance'' studies are presented. The authors clarify the historical and clinical contexts within which these studies were conducted to deconstruct assumptions in interpretations of the results. The discussion makes distinctions between the specific evidence provided by these studies versus the assumptions that have shaped recommendations for care. The affirmative model is presented as a way to move away from the question of, ``How should children's gender identities develop over time?'' toward a more useful question: ``How should children best be supported as their gender identity develops?'' Conclusion: The tethering of childhood gender diversity to the framework of ``desistance'' or ``persistence'' has stifled advancements in our understanding of children's gender in all its complexity. These follow-up studies fall short in helping us understand what children need. As work begins on the 8th version of the Standards of Care by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, we call for a more inclusive conceptual framework that takes children's voices seriously. Listening to children's experiences will enable a more comprehensive understanding of the needs of gender-nonconforming children and provide guidance to scientific and lay communities.},

Current study analyses were limited to two subgroups: trans women (n = 179) and trans men (n = 92). We hypothesized that, as in the general population, exposure to physical and sexual violence would be related to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and substance abuse. Both trans women and trans men in this sample were at high risk for physical and sexual violence, as well as suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Logistic regression analyses indicated that among both trans women and trans men, those who had endured physical and/or sexual violence were significantly more likely than those who had not had such experiences to report a history of suicide attempt and multiple suicide attempts. In addition, among trans men, history of physical and sexual violence were each related to alcohol abuse. Among trans women, history of sexual violence was related to alcohol abuse and illicit substance use. Patterns of violence against transgender people were identified and are discussed, including frequent gender-related motivation for violence, low prevalence of reporting violence to police, and variety of perpetrators of violence.

A convenience sample of 816 TGNC adults responded to measures of current SI, gender minority stressors, and IPTS factors. Path analysis was utilized to test 2 models. Model 1 evaluated the associations between external minority stressors and SI through internal minority stressors. Model 2 examined the relationships between internal minority stressors and SI through IPTS variables (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness). All GMSR external stressors (rejection, nonaffirmation, victimization, and discrimination), internal stressors (internalized transphobia, negative expectations, and nondisclosure), and IPTS factors (thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness) were related to SI. Both models demonstrated good fit. Model 1 revealed that rejection, nonaffirmation, and victimization were related to SI through experiences of internalized transphobia and negative expectations. Model 2 indicated that internalized transphobia and negative expectations were associated with SI through IPTS factors. The models demonstrate pathways through which GMSR and IPTS constructs relate to one another and confer risk for SI among TGNC individuals. These pathways and several recently proposed constructs examined here provide promising directions for future research and clinical interventions in this area.},

  abstract = {Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a life-threatening arrhythmia associated with prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval on the electrocardiogram. More than 100 drugs available in Canada, including widely used antibiotics, antidepressants, cardiovascular drugs and many others, may cause QTc interval prolongation and TdP. Risk factors for TdP include QTc interval {$>$}500 ms, increase in QTc interval {$\geq$}60 ms from the pretreatment value, advanced age, female sex, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, bradycardia, treatment with diuretics and elevated plasma concentrations of QTc interval-prolonging drugs due to drug interactions, inadequate dose adjustment of renally eliminated drugs in patients with kidney disease and rapid intravenous administration. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions associated with the highest risk of TdP include antifungal agents, macrolide antibiotics (except azithromycin) and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus interacting with amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide or pimozide. Other important pharmacokinetic interactions include antidepressants (bupropion, duloxetine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) interacting with flecainide, quinidine or thioridazine. Pharmacists play an important role in minimizing the risk of drug-induced QTc interval prolongation and TdP through knowledge of drugs that are associated with a known or possible risk of TdP, individualized assessment of risk of drug-induced QTc interval prolongation, awareness of drug interactions most likely to result in TdP and attention to dose reduction of renally eliminated QTc interval-prolonging drugs in patients with kidney disease. Treatment of hemodynamically stable TdP consists of discontinuation of the offending drug(s), correction of electrolyte abnormalities and administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate 1 to 2 g.},

  abstract = {AIMS Sexualised drug taking is increasingly reported on national and international levels. We aim to review existing evidence of the relationship between recreational drug use (RDU) and sexual intercourse among men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS We reviewed published abstracts and full articles identified from Cochrane, MEDLINE and Embase databases from November 2010 to 2017. We included any existing studies investigating RDU in MSM and at least one of the following: high-risk sexual practices, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or barriers to accessing specialist support. RESULTS In total, 112 studies were included. Of them, 38 studies specifically reported the prevalence of chemsex-related drug use. Links with sexualised drug taking and high-risk sexual practices including condomless sex and group sex were reported by several studies. Recreational drug use in the sexual setting appears linked to the acquisition of STIs, including hepatitis C, syphilis and gonorrhoea. Reports of adverse mental health outcomes are increasingly described, with several studies documenting chemsex-related inpatient admission. A paucity of research addressing barriers to those accessing specialist drug support services was identified. CONCLUSION This review demonstrates the complex interplay between recreational drug use, high-risk sexual practices and STIs. It identifies the description of adverse mental health outcomes in the chemsex setting, thus highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach across specialties in the management of those adversely affected. Finally, it illuminates the need for future research into perceived barriers of those who require access to support services to ensure timely and comprehensive support provision.},

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION Experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational studies that compared the live attenuated vaccine with the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine, placebo, or no vaccine in adults aged 50 and older. Relevant outcomes were incidence of herpes zoster (primary outcome), herpes zoster ophthalmicus, post-herpetic neuralgia, quality of life, adverse events, and death. RESULTS 27 studies (22 randomised controlled trials) including 2 044 504 patients, along with 18 companion reports, were included after screening 2037 titles and abstracts, followed by 175 full text articles. Network meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials found no statistically significant differences between the live attenuated vaccine and placebo for incidence of laboratory confirmed herpes zoster. The adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine, however, was statistically superior to both the live attenuated vaccine (vaccine efficacy 85\%, 95\% credible interval 31\% to 98\%) and placebo (94\%, 79\% to 98\%). Network meta-analysis of 11 randomised controlled trials showed the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine to be associated with statistically more adverse events at injection sites than the live attenuated vaccine (relative risk 1.79, 95\% credible interval 1.05 to 2.34; risk difference 30\%, 95\% credible interval 2\% to 51\%) and placebo (5.63, 3.57 to 7.29 and 53\%, 30\% to 73\%, respectively). Network meta-analysis of nine randomised controlled trials showed the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine to be associated with statistically more systemic adverse events than placebo (2.28, 1.45 to 3.65 and 20\%, 6\% to 40\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Using the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine might prevent more cases of herpes zoster than using the live attenuated vaccine, but the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine also carries a greater risk of adverse events at injection sites.

This theory has widespread adherents in the field, but the extent to which there is empirical support for the concept of disease interaction remains unclear. In January 2015 we systematically searched 7 bibliographic databases and tracked citations to highly cited publications associated with the theory of syndemics. Of the 783 records, we ultimately included 34 published journal articles, 5 dissertations, and 1 conference abstract. Most studies were based on a cross-sectional design (32 [80\%]), were conducted in the U.S. (32 [80\%]), and focused on men who have sex with men (21 [53\%]). The most frequently studied psychosocial problems were related to mental health (33 [83\%]), substance abuse (36 [90\%]), and violence (27 [68\%]); while the most frequently studied outcome variables were HIV transmission risk behaviors (29 [73\%]) or HIV infection (9 [23\%]). To test the disease interaction concept, 11 (28\%) studies used some variation of a product term, with less than half of these (5/11 [45\%]) providing sufficient information to interpret interaction both on an additive and on a multiplicative scale. The most frequently used specification (31 [78\%]) to test the disease interaction concept was the sum score corresponding to the total count of psychosocial problems. Although the count variable approach does not test hypotheses about interactions between psychosocial problems, these studies were much more likely than others (14/31 [45\%] vs. 0/9 [0\%]; {$\chi$}2=6.25, P=0.01) to incorporate language about "synergy" or "interaction" that was inconsistent with the statistical models used. Therefore, more evidence is needed to assess the extent to which diseases interact, either at the level of populations or individuals, to amplify HIV risk.},

  abstract = {The concept of a syndemic was proposed more than two decades ago to explain how large-scale social forces might give rise to co-occurring epidemics that synergistically interact to undermine health in vulnerable populations. This conceptual instrument has the potential to help policymakers and program implementers in their endeavors to improve population health. Accordingly, it has become an increasingly popular heuristic for advocacy, most notably in the field of HIV treatment and prevention. However, most empirical studies purporting to validate the theory of syndemics actually do no such thing. Tomori et al. (2018) provide a novel case study from India illustrating how the dominant empirical approach fails to promote deeper understanding about how hazardous alcohol use, illicit drug use, depression, childhood sexual abuse, and intimate partner violence interact to worsen HIV risk among men who have sex with men. In this commentary, I relate the theory of syndemics to other established social science and public health theories of disease distribution, identify possible sources of conceptual and empirical confusion, and provide concrete suggestions for how to validate the theory using a mixed-methods approach. The hope is that more evidence can be mobilized \textendash{} whether informed by the theory of syndemics or not \textendash{} to improve health and psychosocial wellbeing among vulnerable populations worldwide.},

  abstract = {Gender-affirming treatment of transgender people requires a multidisciplinary approach in which endocrinologists play a crucial role. The aim of this paper is to review recent data on hormonal treatment of this population and its effect on physical, psychological, and mental health. The Endocrine Society guidelines for transgender women include estrogens in combination with androgen-lowering medications. Feminizing treatment with estrogens and antiandrogens has desired physical changes, such as enhanced breast growth, reduction of facial and body hair growth, and fat redistribution in a female pattern. Possible side effects should be discussed with patients, particularly those at risk for venous thromboembolism. The Endocrine Society guidelines for transgender men include testosterone therapy for virilization with deepening of the voice, cessation of menses, and increases of muscle mass and facial and body hair. Owing to the lack of evidence, treatment of gender nonbinary people should be individualized. Young people may receive pubertal suspension, consisting of GnRH analogs, later followed by sex steroids. Options for fertility preservation should be discussed before any hormonal intervention. Morbidity and cardiovascular risk with cross-sex hormones is unchanged among transgender men and unclear among transgender women. Sex steroid-related malignancies can occur but are rare. Mental health problems such as depression and anxiety have been found to reduce considerably following hormonal treatment. Future studies should aim to explore the long-term outcome of hormonal treatment in transgender people and provide evidence as to the effect of gender-affirming treatment in the nonbinary population.},

  abstract = {Background Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea) could become untreatable in the near future. Indeed, while the treatment of symptomatic gonorrhea in core groups, such men who have sex with men (MSM), is crucial for gonorrhea control programs, screening for and treating asymptomatic gonorrhea/Chlamydia trachomatis(chlamydia) in MSM may contribute to antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea. In this systematic review, we aim to assess if there is evidence that screening MSM for gonorrhea/chlamydia is associated with a decline in the prevalence of these infections. Methods We conducted a systematic review in PubMed and Web of Science for relevant studies including uncontrolled observational studies and reported the results following the PRISMA guidelines. The change in estimated prevalences for chlamydia and gonorrhea across the different time points for 3 anatomical sites (oral, urethral and anal) were collected and examined. Results Twelve studies met our entry criteria. We were able to statistically assess the change in prevalence in 10 of 12 studies. In 3 studies, there was a significant increase in chlamydia prevalence, whereas for gonorrhea, 2 studies reported a significant increase and 2 others a decrease. Our review provides little evidence that screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia in MSM has an effect on the prevalence of these infections. No evidence was found that more frequent screening reduces prevalence more effectively than annual screening. Conclusions Our study was not able to provide evidence that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea lowers the prevalence of these infections in MSM. Randomized controlled trials are required to assess the risks and benefits of gonorrhea/chlamydia screening in high- and low-risk MSM.},

Data were from a sample of high needs substance-using, HIV-infected people in South Florida between 2010 and 2012 (n~=~481). We used confirmatory factor analysis to measure a syndemic latent variable and applied measurement invariance models to identify group differences in the data structure of syndemic co-morbidities among heterosexual men, heterosexual women, and MSM. We found that variables used to measure the syndemic fit each sub-group, supporting that substance use disorder, violence, and mental health coincide in HIV-infected individuals. Heterosexual men and MSM demonstrated similar syndemic latent variable factor loadings, but significantly different item intercepts, indicating that heterosexual men had larger mean values on substance use disorder, anxiety, and depression than MSM. Heterosexual men and heterosexual women demonstrated significantly different syndemic variable factor loadings, indicating that anxiety and depression contribute more (and substance use contributes less) to the syndemic in heterosexual men compared to heterosexual women. MSM and heterosexual women demonstrated similar syndemic latent variable factor loadings and intercepts, but had significantly different factor residual variances indicating more variance in violent victimization and depression for MSM and more variance in stress for heterosexual women than what is captured by the observed syndemic indicators. Furthermore, heterosexual women had a larger syndemic factor mean than MSM, indicating that the syndemic burden is greater among heterosexual women than MSM. Our findings support that measurement invariance can elucidate differences in the syndemic to tailor interventions to sub-group needs.},

This study examined how multiple co-occurring psychosocial problems, also known as a syndemic, contribute to high-risk sexual behavior among GBM. It also examined the impact of early life adversity on high-risk sexual behavior as mediated by syndemic severity. A sample of 239 GBM completed self-report questionnaires at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Syndemic variables included depression, polysubstance use, and intimate partner violence. Early life adversity variables measured retrospectively included physical and verbal bullying by peers and physical and sexual abuse by adults. A Cochran-Armitage trend test revealed a proportionate increase between number of syndemic problems and engagement in high-risk sex (p~{$<~$}.0001), thereby supporting syndemic theory. All early life adversity variables were positively correlated with number of syndemic problems. A bootstrap mediation analysis revealed indirect effects of two types of early life adversity on high-risk sex via syndemic severity: verbal bullying by peers and physical abuse by adults. There was also an overall effect of physical bullying by peers on high-risk sexual behavior, but no specific direct or indirect effects were observed. Consistent with syndemic theory, results provide evidence that certain types of early life adversity impact high-risk sex later in life via syndemic problems. Behavioral interventions to reduce sexual risk among GBM should address anti-gay discrimination experienced before adulthood as well as adult psychological problems.},

Regulatory approvals have been gained across a broad range of palliative and therapeutic indications, and in some cases, included in standard treatment guidelines. Areas covered: The use of Cannabis and cannabinoid-based-medicines in oncology is summarized in this article. Cannabinoids are classified according to natural and synthetic subtypes and their mechanisms of action expounded. The variability of available products is discussed in the clinical context and data regarding chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, cancer-related pain, anorexia, insomnia, and anxiety are presented. Moreover, immunological and antineoplastic effects in preclinical and clinical trials are addressed. Concepts such as synergism or opposition with conventional treatment modalities, the sequence of administration and dosage, molecular cross-talk and malignancy-cannabinoid congruence, are explored. Finally, side-effects, limitations in trial design and legislation barriers are related. Expert opinion: Sufficient evidence supports the use of Cannabis for palliative indications in oncology; however, patients should be carefully selected, guided and followed. Promising research suggests the potent antineoplastic activity, but more data must be accrued before conclusions can be drawn.},

In contrast to the most common method for assessing syndemics, the use of a syndemic component index, latent class analysis can identify unique combinations of risk factors that may form a syndemic. Analyzing a primarily heterosexual sample of 1,786 Black men from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we used a 4 latent class model based on depression diagnosis, poverty, and healthcare access to predict ever having been HIV tested. Class 1 was characterized by low proportions of all the risk factors. Class 2 had relatively high healthcare barriers, being the most likely to not have a personal doctor (.8175) and the most likely to have no routine checkup in the past year (.6327) but had relatively low depression diagnosis and poverty. Class 3 had relatively high poverty (.8853), but generally low barriers to healthcare access. Class 4 was characterized by high proportions of all the risk factors. Using log-binomial regression models, there was a significantly lower prevalence of ever having been HIV tested among class 3 (PR\,=\,0.69, 95\% CI 0.49, 0.98) and class 4 (PR\,=\,0.49, 95\% CI 0.28, 0.84) compared to class 1.~When adjusting for education, age, and marital status, the associations were attenuated but still significant for class 3 (aPR\,=\,0.71, 95\% CI 0.52, 0.96) and class 4 (aPR\,=\,0.60, 95\% CI 0.46, 0.78). Latent class analysis may better serve syndemic research aims in understanding HIV-related outcomes among high-risk populations. Future research using this method to evaluate HIV testing outcomes among BMSM is recommended.},

AMSM experience more victimization (including sexual/partner violence), depression, and substance abuse than their heterosexual counterparts; these may form a syndemic associated with risky sexual behavior. We pooled data from the 2015 and 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, restricted to male students who reported a previous male sexual partner (n = 448). Latent profile analysis was used to identify syndemic profiles, with log-binomial and cumulative complementary log-log models used to test associations with substance use at last intercourse, condomless sex at last intercourse, and the number of sexual partners. Nearly all measures of victimization, depression, and substance use had bivariate associations with greater substance use during sex and more sexual partners. We identified three profiles of AMSM: The profile (n = 55) with the greatest risk factors (evident of a syndemic) had substantially higher prevalence of substance use during sex (aPR = 4.74, 95\% CI 3.02, 7.43) and more sexual partners (aPR = 2.45, 95\% CI 1.39, 4.31) than the profile with the lowest risk factors (n = 326) after adjusting for confounders. This profile was not associated with condomless sex. We identified a syndemic characterized by victimization, depression, and substance use associated with risky sexual behaviors in a nationally representative sample of AMSM. Comprehensive sexual risk reduction interventions incorporating mental health and substance use are critically important in this population.},

Traumatic experiences and mental health challenges may interact to create a syndemic associated with substance use in this population; this may be moderated by social support however., METHODS: Using a multicenter prospective cohort of 1068 BSMM, we conducted a longitudinal syndemic latent transition analysis testing whether baseline and 6-month race and sexuality-targeted violence, intimate partner violence, other traumatic experiences, depression, and internalized homophobia was associated with 12-month substance use. We also tested if social support modified this and was associated with transitions between statuses., RESULTS: Our analysis identified four statuses: A "low-risk" status characterized by the lowest proportions of syndemic factors, and 3 "high-risk" statuses, characterized by higher proportions of syndemic factors. All three high-risk statuses were associated with higher substance use than the low-risk status, with the greatest association observed with "high-risk status C" (aRR = 4.54, 95 \% CI 1.98, 10.40). Social support attenuated this association (Interaction aRR = 0.21, 95 \% CI 0.05, 0.85) and was associated with lower transition rates from low to high-risk status 6 months later (Transition ratio = 0.45, 95 \% CI 0.29, 0.69)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identified a syndemic of trauma, depression, and homophobia among BSMM associated with substance use, but attenuated by social support.

We reviewed the literature and interviewed nine key informants representing healthcare and service providers, researchers, and transgender advocates. Healthcare providers who care for transgender patients often demonstrate a lack of transgender competent care strategies. In addition, transgender people face many barriers to accessing HIV services. Although communication materials cannot address many of these barriers, materials specifically developed for transgender people and their healthcare providers would fill a gap and may increase uptake of HIV services. Materials for transgender people should include gender-affirming messaging and imagery, be framed in terms of resiliency, and present HIV information tailored to the needs of transgender people. Materials for healthcare providers should provide basic information to increase transgender competency and provision of comprehensive healthcare for transgender patients, inclusive of gender-affirming and HIV prevention, testing and care services.

We explored experiences of perceived discrimination, medical mistrust, and behavior disclosure among male sex workers compared to other men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted 56 interviews with MSM and compared findings about medical mistrust, discrimination, and disclosure for 31 men who engaged in sex work vs. 25 men who did not. MSM who engaged in sex work reported more medical mistrust and healthcare discrimination due to issues beyond MSM behavior/identity (e.g., homelessness, substance use, poverty). MSM who did not report sex work described disclosing sex with men to clinicians more often. Both subgroups reported low PrEP awareness, but willingness to disclose behavior to obtain PrEP. Medical mistrust and perceived discrimination create barriers for sexual behavior disclosure to clinicians, potentially impeding access to PrEP and other forms of biomedical HIV prevention. These barriers may be higher among male sex workers compared to other MSM, given overlapping stigmas including sex work, substance use, homelessness, and poverty. An intersectionality framework for understanding multiple stigmas can help to identify how these dynamics may limit access to biomedical HIV prevention among male sex workers, as well as suggesting strategies for addressing stigmas to improve the delivery of PrEP and other HIV prevention approaches in this population.},

  abstract = {In 2010, men who have sex with men (MSM) represented 4\% of the population in the United States (US) and accounted for 78\% of all new Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections among Hispanic men. Hispanic men who have sex with men (HMSM) accounted for the third largest number of new HIV infections (6,700 cases). This dissertation explored the effects of age, loneliness, substance use, depression, and social support on high risk sexual behaviors that predispose middle aged HMSM to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV infection risk. A sample of 150 urban HMSM aged 40 to 65 were surveyed in this study. Singer's Syndemics Theory (1996) provided this study's theoretical framework. Data was analyzed using a variety of parametric and non-parametric statistics. Loneliness, social support, depressive symptoms, alcohol/drug use, and sexual risk behaviors were found to have an influence on HIV infection status in this study. Partner status, religious affiliation and age did have an influence on alcohol use in this study's participants. Also, participants with increased age had increased depressive symptoms in this study. Lastly, depressive symptoms, substance use, social support, and loneliness did have an influence on sexual risk behaviors in this study's participants, specifically alcohol use and illicit drug use. The findings from this study should be used to assess, diagnose, plan, implement and evaluate prevention strategies geared to reduce STI and HIV infection in this population.

  abstract = {Previous studies documenting sexual minority women's disproportionate risk for a range of medical, mental health, and substance use disorders have not provided a predictive framework for understanding their interrelations and outcomes. The present study aimed to address this gap by testing the syndemic effect of co-occurring psychosocial problems on 7-year health care costs and utilization among sexual minority women. The sample was comprised of sexual minority women (N\,=\,341) who were seen at an urban LGBT-affirmative community health center. Medical and mental health care utilization and cost data were extracted from electronic medical records. Demographically adjusted regression models revealed that co-occurring psychosocial problems (i.e., childhood sexual abuse, partner violence, substance use, and mental health distress [history of suicide attempt]) were all strongly interrelated. The presence of these indicators had a syndemic (additive) effect on medical costs and utilization and mental health utilization over 7-year follow-up, but no effect on 7-year mental health costs. These results suggest that the presence and additive effect of these syndemic conditions may, in part, explain increased medical costs and utilization (and higher medical morbidity) among sexual minority women.},

Homophobic rejection by parents was also associated with actual suicide attempts. Suicidality in this population could be reduced by supporting coping strategies of LGB youth who are confronted with stigmatization by peers and parents, and by schools actively promoting acceptance of same-sex sexuality. Method Studies have shown that rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth are higher than among heterosexually identified youth (1). Also, suicide attempts in LGB adolescents are positively associated with the parents' negative responses to their offspring's sexual orientation (2) Furthermore, victimization at school is positively related to lifetime suicide attempts and to suicidal ideation in the previous year (3,4). While LGB adolescents experience victimization in various social contexts, it is not clear which social context (parents, family members outside the nuclear family, school, and neighborhood) is most crucial in determining suicidality. The present study is one of the first studies to examine this issue.},

Previous research has shown an increased risk of attempted suicide associated with a homosexual orientation. However, the mechanisms underlying this increased risk are not yet clear. This study therefore aimed to determine the risk of attempted suicide and the effect of potential risk factors on the occurrence of suicidal ideation and behaviour among homosexual youngsters. METHODS: The association between suicidal ideation and behaviour and potential risk factors was assessed by means of a questionnaire in a general population sample of homosexual or bisexual young people and a control sample consisting of school pupils. RESULTS: A twofold increased risk of suicidal ideation was found associated with a homosexual or bisexual orientation. A significantly increased risk of attempted suicide associated with homosexuality or bisexuality was found in females. Independent of sexual orientation, depression was identified as a significant risk factor for suicidal ideation, while suicidal behaviour was associated with low self-esteem, higher levels of hopelessness and suicidal behaviour in someone close. Among homosexual or bisexual young people, less satisfying homosexual friendships were an additional risk factor for suicidal behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The identified increased risk of suicidal ideation among homosexual or bisexual young people is associated with depression and may lead to suicidal behaviour, independent of sexual orientation, especially in the presence of a role model of suicidal behaviour, and among those with unsatisfying friendships.},

Methods: An internet-based survey in Dutch and French on sexual behaviour and sexual transmitted diseases (STDs) was administered during the months of February and March 2015. The survey assessed prevalence of STD, the use, attitude towards and knowledge of safe sex, frequency of Pap smears and quality of relationships with caregivers. Results: Among the 209 Belgian participants, 34,9\% declared to have at least one STD. The most reported STDs were candida (16,3\%) and bacterial vaginosis (13,9\%). The occurrence of STD with a serious impact on health were minimal (Chlamydia 1.9\%, herpes 3\%) to none (hepatitis, hiv). Sex with a man and a higher number of sex partners were found to be associated risk factors for a STD. Only 10 - 20 \% of WSW reported to have safe sexual encounters, highly depending on which sexual act was performed. Only 34.3\% of WSW had a Pap smear done in a 3 year interval and 37,3\% of the {$>$}25 years women admitted they did not have one yet. Relationships with caregivers were positively appreciated, although most women stated they received little or no education about safe sex their relationships. Conclusion: With a relatively high incidence of STDs, but none with serious impact on general health, the lack of safe sex use in this population seems to be a debatable problem. These findings highlight the need for more information and education about female homosexual eroticism and safe sex.},

In this review, we discuss recent data on the prevalence of alcohol and noninjection drug use and the relationship to HIV acquisition and transmission risk., RECENT FINDINGS: A strong association between alcohol use and HIV-infection risk has been demonstrated in multiple studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Among men who have sex with men in the USA as well as other countries, substance use is highly prevalent and has been associated with high-risk sexual behavior. Substance use, mental health problems, and sexual risk behaviors conjoin in what is known as a syndemic to increase HIV risk among young men who have sex with men. Only a limited number of intervention studies provide promising results in reducing HIV-infection risk among substance users., SUMMARY: Alcohol and noninjection drug use is prevalent in certain populations. There is a strong association between use of alcohol and noninjecting substances, including methamphetamines, amyl nitrates, cocaine, and other drugs, and HIV-infection risk. This underscores the need for a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy that addresses substance use, including screening and behavioral intervention, among those at risk.},

Our aim was to systematically review the literature concerning the effects of testosterone on body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, hematocrit, hemoglobin, lipid profile, and liver enzymes in transgender men. PUBMED and EMBASE were searched for studies published until March 2017. Studies were included if they reported interventions with any dose of testosterone and comparison of variables before and during treatment. Of 455 potentially eligible articles, 13 were reviewed. Study duration ranged from 6 to 60 months, sample size ranged from 12 to 97 patients, and the most common treatment was parenteral testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg/12 weeks. Slight but significant increases in BMI were reported (from 1.3 to 11.4\%). Three out of seven studies assessing the impact of different testosterone formulations on blood pressure detected modest increases or clinically irrelevant changes in this variable. In another study, however, two patients developed hypertension, which was resolved after cessation of testosterone therapy. Decreases in HDL-cholesterol and increases in LDL-cholesterol were consistently observed. Eight studies observed a relationship between testosterone and increased hemoglobin (range: 4.9\textendash 12.5\%) and hematocrit (range: 4.4\textendash 17.6\%), but discontinuation of androgen therapy was not necessary. In one study, two patients developed erythrocytosis (hematocrit {$>$}52\%) after 9 and 12 months of treatment. One study analyzing testosterone formulations observed smaller increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit with testosterone gel. Six studies assessing liver function showed slight or no changes. Overall, the quality of evidence was low, given the lack of randomized clinical/controlled trials and the small sample sizes. In conclusion, exogenous testosterone administration to transgender men was associated with modest increases in BMI, hemoglobin/hematocrit, and LDL-cholesterol, and with decreases in HDL-cholesterol. Long-term studies are needed to assess the long-term risks of testosterone therapy, particularly as they relate to cardiometabolic risks such as diabetes, dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome.},

Characteristics of clustered patients, paired patients and patients on isolated branches in the phylogenetic tree were compared. The results revealed an overall high level of clustering despite the short time frame of sampling, with 47.6\% of all patients having at least one close genetic counterpart and 36.6\% belonging to a cluster of 3 or more individuals. Compared to patients on isolated branches, patients in clusters more frequently reported being infected in Belgium (95.1\% vs. 47.6\%; p {$<$} 0.001), were more frequently men having sex with men (MSM) (77.9\% vs. 42.8\%; p {$<$} 0.001), of Belgian origin (68.2\% vs. 32.9\%; p {$<$} 0.001), male gender (92.6\% vs. 65.8\%; p {$<$} 0.001), infected with subtype B or F (87.8\% vs. 43.4\%; p {$<$} 0.001) and diagnosed early after infection (55.4\% vs. 29.0\%; p {$<$} 0.001). Strikingly, Sub-Saharan Africans (SSA), overall representing 27.1\% of the population were significantly less frequently found in clusters than on individual branches (6.0\% vs. 41.8\%; p {$<$} 0.001). Of the SSA that participated in clustered transmission, 66.7\% were MSM and this contrasts sharply with the overall 12.0\% of SSA reporting MSM. Transmission clusters with SSA were more frequently non-B clusters than transmission clusters without SSA (44.4\% versus 18.2\%). MSM-driven clusters with patients of mixed origin may account, at least in part, for the increasing spread of non-B subtypes to the native MSM population, a cross-over that has been particularly successful for subtype F and CRF02\_AG. The main conclusions from this study are that clustered transmission in Belgium remains almost exclusively MSM-driven with very limited contribution of SSA. There were no indications for local ongoing clustered transmission of HIV-1 among SSA.},

  abstract = {Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case econtrol, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. 18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, caseecontrol, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the Web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

Respectful health care that addresses sexual and reproductive concerns is a right for everyone, including those who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). LGBT persons have unique reproductive health care needs as well as increased risks for poor health outcomes. Both the World Health Organization and Healthy People 2020 identified the poor health of LGBT persons as an area for improvement. A lack of educational resources as well as few student clinical experiences with an LGBT population may be barriers to providing respectful sexual and reproductive health care to LGBT persons. This article offers didactic educational strategies for midwifery and graduate nursing education programs that may result in reducing barriers to the provision of respectful sexual and reproductive health care for LGBT clients. Specific ideas for implementation are discussed in detail. In addition to what is presented here, other educational strategies and clinical experiences may help to support students for caring for LGBT persons prior to entrance into clinical practice.

In the Framingham study, clinically apparent thyroid nodules were present in 6.4\% of females and 1.5\% of males.1 There may be even more thyroid nodules that are undetected, and postmortem studies demonstrate thyroid nodules in half of all patients.2 Many nodules can be managed in primary care, but some patients will require referral to secondary care. The aim of this article is to arm a GP with the information required to confidently assess which patients require referral, and in what timeframe. The gap between the 1.5\textendash 6.4\% of palpable nodules found in the Framingham study and the 50\% found at post-mortem implies that there is an enormous volume of nodules that are not clinically apparent. With the development of increasingly sophisticated imaging modalities there has been an epidemic of thyroid 'incidentalomas'. These non-palpable nodules are seen in at least 20\% of ultrasound scans, 25\% of contrast-enhanced chest CTs, 15\% of MRI neck scans, and 30\% of PET-CT scans.3 Most patients with incidentally discovered thyroid nodules can be managed by the same principles of history and examination as those with palpable lumps. There are two exceptions to this rule, the first being incidental thyroid lumps on CT, MRI, or ultrasound scan (USS) that are {$<$}1 cm and have no associated lymphadenopathy.

He believes he may have been exposed to covid-19 but, at the time, did not meet the criteria for testing.  With the discovery of covid-19 and as the clinical syndromes associated with this virus have been defined, many areas of practice require updating. This article is a guide to assessment and management of patients with loss of smell based on review of the current literature and guidelines from the British Rhinology Society and ENT UK, the professional membership body representing ear, nose, and throat surgery in the UK.1 Olfactory dysfunction is common: estimates of point prevalence in the general population before the covid-19 pandemic suggest that 19.1\% of adults (80\% in people over 75) suffer from complete or partial loss of smell.2 Causes can be broadly subdivided into conductive (physical barriers to odorants reaching the olfactory system) and sensorineural (failure of the olfactory system to detect odorants). Causes are outlined in table 1, with the more common causes in the top half of the table and less common causes in the bottom half.

We utilize a syndemic framework to account for co-occurring psychosocial problems that suggest the presence of intertwining epidemics (i.e., syndemics), which have not been examined within the context of exchange sex among HIV-positive MSM. In 2015, MSM were recruited via online sexual networking Web site and app advertisements for Sex Positive![+], a video-based online intervention that aimed to improve health outcomes for men living with HIV. Participants completed surveys every three months for a year. Surveys covered demographics, drug use, exchange sex, intimate partner violence (IPV), and past 2-week depressive symptoms. We conducted three logistic regression models to assess syndemic factors associated with exchange sex in the past 3 months. Of the 722 HIV-positive MSM included in the sample, 59 (8\%) reported exchange sex in the past 3 months at 12-month follow-up. HIV-positive MSM who had more syndemic factors had greater odds of exchange sex. Exchange sex was associated with being African-American/Black, age 18\textendash 29 years, past and present experiences with IPV, stimulant use, polysubstance use, and depressive symptoms. Exchange sex was associated with multiple psychosocial factors, indicating exchange sex may be part of a syndemic involving substance use, depression, HIV, and IPV. Interventions should address the social and behavioral circumstances that perpetuate environments that can foster multiple negative health outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have discussed the overlapping and reinforcing effects (defined as a syndemic) of psychosocial problems on high-risk sexual behaviors among men who have sex with men (MSM). The present study aimed to apply the syndemic theory to verify the reinforcing effects of psychosocial problems on unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) among MSM in Shanghai, and determine if other important psychosocial factors fit into the syndemic theory. METHODS: Data were collected from 547 MSM in Shanghai, China, through face-to-face interviews. The measures for psychosocial problems included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale; the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale; and the Sexual Compulsivity Scale. We used multivariate analysis and binary logistic regression to investigate the associations between psychosocial problems and high-risk sexual behaviors. RESULTS: The prevalence of UAI among MSM in the past 6~months was 54.5\%. Education (graduate from college vs. high school) served as a protective factor against UAI (OR 0.59, 95\% CI: 0.38-0.94). There was a high prevalence of psychosocial problems, and at least one-third of participants reported experiencing more than two psychosocial symptoms. Of these psychosocial factors that we investigated, lower self-esteem was associated with UAI in both univariate and multivariate regression model (P\,=\,0.009). Result suggests that overlapping and reinforcing effects of psychosocial problems may increase high risk sexual behaviors among MSM in Shanghai, China (OR 1.65, 95\% CI: 1.09-2.50; P\,=\,0.018). CONCLUSIONS: We found further evidence for a syndemic of psychosocial problems among MSM in Shanghai, China. This syndemic may also increase high risk sexual behaviors among MSM. Most HIV prevention interventions are focused on behavior change and only have moderate effects; our findings suggest that a shift from behavior-focused interventions to a more comprehensive strategy that addresses psychosocial factors may be necessary.},

The immunological interaction between HIV-1 and \emph{Mtb} has been largely defined by how the virus exacerbates tuberculosis disease pathogenesis. Understanding of the mechanisms by which pre-existing or subsequent \emph{Mtb} infection may favor the replication, persistence and progression of HIV, is less characterized. We present a rationale for the critical consideration of 'latent' \emph{Mtb} infection in HIV-1 prevention and cure strategies. In support of this position, we review evidence of the effect of \emph{Mtb} infection on HIV-1 acquisition, replication and persistence. We propose that 'latent' \emph{Mtb} infection may have considerable impact on HIV-1 pathogenesis and the continuing HIV-1 epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The proposed impact of \emph{Mycobacterium tuberculosis} (\emph{Mtb}) coinfection (solid lines) on the life-course progression of HIV-1 infection (dotted lines). In addition to enhancing the speed of AIDS progression and tuberculosis development in those HIV-1 infected, \emph{Mtb} infection increases myeloid and T-cell immune activation and the susceptibility of cells to HIV-1 infection and HIV-1 replication in infected and bystander cells. Following antiretroviral therapy initiation, a larger pool of reservoir cells harboring HIV-1 and higher immune activation status has the potential to result in more frequent blips in viremia above the level of clinical detection (thin line).},

Transcripts were subjected to a thematic analysis. Results We broadly distinguished two groups of reasons for combining sex and drugs, within which we described eight distinct motivations. The first major group of motivations for combining drugs with sex was that drugs provide the means by which men can have the sex they desire by increasing libido, confidence, disinhibition and stamina. The second major group of motivations for chemsex was that drugs enhance the qualities of the sex that men value. Drugs made other men seem more attractive, increased physical sensations, intensified perceptions of intimacy and facilitated a sense of sexual adventure. Conclusion Analysis revealed that sexualised drug use provides both motivation and capability to engage in the kinds of sex that some gay men value: Sex that explores and celebrates adventurism. Those services providing (talking) interventions to men engaging in chemsex should consider these benefits of sexualised drug use alongside the harms arising.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Syndemic theory has provided insight into the ways that disease states and social adversity interact in marginalized populations to further disempower these groups. Yet, until recently, scholars have not identified how we might actually recognize and measure a syndemic, as opposed to a situation where there are multiple but non-interacting diseases present in a population. As researchers like those included in this special issue develop new methods for assessing syndemic interactions in diverse global populations, this short communication argues for the value of locally relevant measures. Poverty, mental health, food insecurity, and type 2 diabetes are used to illustrate the assessment of a potential syndemic from a locally grounded perspective. The discussion emphasizes the insights locally adapted measures can add, and what information would be lost without their use.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Methods In this retrospective analysis of 161 ASCT patients we used serial analyses of urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate (3-IS) levels and GI microbiome parameters within the first 10 days after ASCT to identify potential commensal microbiota sparing antibiotics. Based on antibiotic activity we formed 3 subgroups (Rifaximin without systemic antibiotics, Rifaximin with systemic antibiotics and Ciprofloxacin/Metronidazole with/without systemic antibiotics). Results Mono-antibiosis with Rifaximin revealed higher 3-IS levels (p{$<$}0.001), higher Clostridium Cluster XIVa (CCXIVa) abundance (p=0.004) and higher Shannon index (p=0.01) compared to Ciprofloxacin/Metronidazole with/without systemic antibiotics. Rifaximin followed by systemic antibiotics maintained microbiome diversity compared to Ciprofloxacin/Metronidazole with/without systemic antibiotics as these patients showed still higher 3-IS levels (p=0.04), higher CCXIVa copy numbers (p=0.01) and higher Shannon index (p=0.01). Even for this larger cohort of patients, outcome was superior with regard to GI-GvHD (p=0.05) and lower transplant related mortality (TRM, p{$<$}0.001) for patients receiving Rifaximin plus systemic antibiotics compared to other types of systemic antibiotic treatment. Antibiosis with Ciprofloxacin/Metronidazole (n=12,p=0.01), Piperacillin/Tazobactam (n=52,p=0.01), Meropenem/Vancomycin (n=16,p=0.003), Ceftazidime (n=10,p=0.03) or multiple systemic antibiotics (n=53,p=0.001) showed significantly lower 3-IS levels compared to mono-antibiosis with Rifaximin (n=14) or intravenous Vancomycin (n=4,n.s.). Conclusions The use of different types of antibiotic treatment shows different impact on markers of microbiome diversity. Identification of antibiotics sparing commensal bacteria remains an unsolved challenge. However, Rifaximin allowed a higher intestinal microbiome diversity even in the presence of systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an overview and descriptive results from the first egocentric network study of men who have sex with men (MSM) from across the United States: the ARTnet study. ARTnet was designed to support prevention research for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are transmitted across partnership networks. ARTnet implemented a population-based egocentric network study design that sampled egos from the target population and asked them to report on the number, attributes, and timing of their sexual partnerships. Such data provide the foundation needed for parameterizing stochastic network models that are used for disease projection and intervention planning. ARTnet collected data online from 2017 to 2019, with a final sample of 4904 participants who reported on 16198 sexual partnerships. The aims of this paper were to characterize the joint distribution of three network parameters needed for modeling: degree distributions, assortative mixing, and partnership age, with heterogeneity by partnership type (main, casual and one-time), demography, and geography. Participants had an average of 1.19 currently active partnerships (``mean degree''), which was higher for casual partnerships (0.74) than main partnerships (0.45). The mean rate of one-time partnership acquisition was 0.16 per week (8.5 partners per year). Main partnerships lasted 272.5 weeks on average, while casual partnerships lasted 133.0 weeks. There was strong but heterogenous assortative mixing by race/ethnicity for all groups. The mean absolute age difference for all partnership types was 9.5 years, with main partners differing by 6.3 years compared to 10.8 years for casual partners. Our analysis suggests that MSM may be at sustained risk for HIV/STI acquisition and transmission through high network degree of sexual partnerships. The ARTnet network study provides a robust and reproducible foundation for understanding the dynamics of HIV/STI epidemiology among U.S. MSM and supporting the implementation science that seeks to address persistent challenges in HIV/STI prevention.},

  abstract = {Setting Syndemics occur when two or more health conditions interact to increase morbidity and mortality and are exacerbated by social, economic, environmental, and political factors. Routine provincial surveillance in Ontario assesses and reports on the epidemiology of single infectious diseases separately. Therefore, we aimed to develop a method that allows disease overlaps to be examined routinely as a path to better understanding and addressing syndemics in Ontario. Intervention We extracted data for individuals with a record of chlamydia, gonorrhea, infectious syphilis, hepatitis B and C, HIV/AIDS, invasive group A streptococcal disease (iGAS), or tuberculosis in Ontario's reportable disease database from 1990 to 2018. We transformed the data into a person-based integrated surveillance dataset retaining individuals (clients) with at least one record between 2006 and 2018. Outcomes The resulting dataset had 659,136 unique disease records among 470,673 unique clients. Of those clients, 23.1\% had multiple disease records with 50 being the most for one client. We described the frequency of disease overlaps; for example, 34.7\% of clients with a syphilis record had a gonorrhea record. We quantified known overlaps, finding 1274 clients had gonorrhea, infectious syphilis, and HIV/AIDS records, and potentially emerging overlaps, finding 59 clients had HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, and iGAS records. Implications Our novel person-based integrated surveillance dataset represents a platform for ongoing in-depth assessment of disease overlaps such as the relative timing of disease records. It enables a more client-focused approach, is a step towards improved characterization of syndemics in Ontario, and could inform other jurisdictions interested in adopting similar approaches.},

Methods Logistic regression analyses were conducted on the data generated by the San Francisco Unified School District's 2011 California Healthy Kids Survey to examine the influence of protective factors related to suicidal ideation for LGB adolescents (n = 356). Results Results indicated that higher levels of school connectedness predicted less suicidal ideation (odds ratio =.59, p =. 005).

  abstract = {Introduction. In trans women (male-to-female transsexual persons), cross-sex hormone therapy is administered to induce feminization. Breast development is an important part of feminization for most trans women. Aim. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of cross-sex hormone therapy on breast development in adult trans women. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the benefit or harm of administration of progestogens on breast development. Methods. A review of the literature in Embase, Medline, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO databases, PubMed, and Web of Knowledge until January 2014. Main Outcome Measures. Effects of cross-sex hormone therapy and progestogens on breast development in trans women. Results. Only few studies with low quality of evidence addressed these topics. The available evidence suggests that breast development is insufficient for the majority of trans women and that type and dosage of hormonal therapy seem not to have an important role on final breast size. Conclusions. Our knowledge concerning the natural history and effects of different cross-sex hormone therapies on breast development in trans women is extremely sparse and based on low quality of evidence. Current evidence does not provide evidence that progestogens enhance breast development in trans women. Neither do they prove the absence of such an effect. This prevents us from drawing any firm conclusion at this moment and demonstrates the need for further research to clarify these important clinical questions. Wierckx K, Gooren L, and T'Sjoen G.

Resilience is a process through which YBGBM achieve positive psychosocial outcomes in the face of adverse conditions. Self-efficacy, hardiness and adaptive coping, and social support may be important resilience factors for YBGBM. This study explores different profiles of these resilience factors in 228 YBGBM in New York City and compares profiles on psychological distress, mental health, and other psychosocial factors. Four profiles of resilience were identified: (a) Low self-efficacy and hardiness/adaptive coping (23.5\%); (b) Low peer and parental support (21.2\%); (c) High peer support, low father support (34.5\%); and (d) High father and mother support, self-efficacy, and hardiness/adaptive coping (20.8\%). YBGBM in profile 1 scored markedly higher on distress (d = .74) and lower on mental health functioning (d = .93) compared to men in the other profiles. Results suggest that self-efficacy and hardiness/adaptive coping may play a more important role in protecting YBGBM from risks compared to social support and should be targeted in interventions. The findings show that resilience is a multidimensional construct and support the notion that there are different patterns of resilience among YBGBM.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To maximize public health impact and cost-effectiveness, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) must reach individuals at high HIV risk. Referrals for PrEP can be self- or provider-initiated, but there are several challenges to both. We assessed whether HIV risk differed by referral source among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex (gbMSM) screening for an HIV PrEP demonstration project. METHODS: PREPARATORY-5 was an open-label PrEP demonstration project enrolling gbMSM at high risk of HIV acquisition in Toronto, Canada. Study eligibility criteria related to high risk was defined as scoring {$\geq$}10 on the HIV Incidence Risk Index for MSM (HIRI-MSM) and engaging in at least 1 act of condomless receptive anal sex within the past 6~months. Recruitment was promoted through self-referrals (ads in a sexual networking app and gay newspaper/website) and provider-referrals (10 community-based organizations, CBOs). HIV risk score (HIRI-MSM) and syndemic health burden were measured among gbMSM screened for study participation and compared according to referral source. RESULTS: Between October 16 and December 30, 2014, online ads generated 1518 click-throughs and CBOs referred 115 individuals. Overall, 165 men inquired about the trial, of which 86 underwent screening. The majority of screened men were self-referrals (60.5\%), scored {$\geq$}10 on HIRI-MSM (96.5\%), and reported condomless receptive anal sex in the past 6~months (74.2\%). Self- and provider-referrals had similarly high HIV risk profiles, with a median (IQR) HIRI-MSM score of 26.0 (19.0-32.5) and 28.5 (20.0-34.0) (p\,=\,0.3), and 75.0\% and 73.5\% reporting condomless receptive anal sex (p\,=\,0.9), respectively. The overall burden of syndemic health problems was also high, with approximately one-third overall identified as having depressive symptoms (39.5\%), alcohol-related problems (39.5\%), multiple drug use (31.4\%), or sexual compulsivity (31.4\%). There were no significant differences in syndemic health problems by referral source. CONCLUSIONS: HIV risk and syndemic burden were high among gbMSM presenting for this PrEP demonstration project regardless of referral source. Self-referral may be a useful and efficient strategy for identifying individuals suitable for PrEP use. Online strategies and CBOs working in gay men's health may play important roles in connecting individuals at high HIV risk to PrEP services. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02149888 .

  abstract = {Men who have sex with men (MSM) are confronted with different health problems. Next to a higher HIV prevalence and a higher reporting of depressive symptoms and other mental health problems, there is also evidence of substance dependence and sexual compulsivity occurring simultaneously. Using a sample of 591 HIV-negative Belgian MSM, we examine the relationships between depressive symptoms and other risk factors of unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) practice with casual partners. These risk factors include depressive symptoms, sexual behavioural indicators, individual risk perception of UAI, intrapersonal factors measured by the sexual sensation seeking scale, substance use, sources of social support and social norming regarding condom use and finally the location where or media through which men find sex partners. Our findings show that multifactorial, intertwined factors contribute to the explanation of UAI among MSM at risk for HIV infection. These findings underline the need for an integrated sexual health approach for MSM.},

  abstract = {Gender-based violence (GBV) is an umbrella term for any harm that is perpetrated against a person's will and that results from power inequalities based on gender roles. Most global estimates of GBV implicitly refer only to the experiences of cisgender, heterosexually identified women, which often comes at the exclusion of transgender and gender nonconforming (trans) populations. Those who perpetrate violence against trans populations often target gender nonconformity, gender expression or identity, and perceived sexual orientation and thus these forms of violence should be considered within broader discussions of GBV. Nascent epidemiologic research suggests a high burden of GBV among trans populations, with an estimated prevalence that ranges from 7\% to 89\% among trans populations and subpopulations. Further, 165 trans persons have been reported murdered in the United States between 2008 and 2016. GBV is associated with multiple poor health outcomes and has been broadly posited as a component of syndemics, a term used to describe an interaction of diseases with underlying social forces, concomitant with limited prevention and response programs. The interaction of social stigma, inadequate laws, and punitive policies as well as a lack of effective GBV programs limits access to and use of GBV prevention and response programs among trans populations. This commentary summarizes the current body of research on GBV among trans populations and highlights areas for future research, intervention, and policy.},

  abstract = {Background: Depression is a serious disorder which significantly impacts wellbeing and quality of life. Studies exploring mental wellbeing in the transgender population are mostly limited by small, non-homogenous samples and lack of matched controls. This study aimed to address these limitations and explore depression rates in a large sample of transgender people, compared with matched controls from the general population, as well as factors predicting depression in those taking cross-sex hormone treatment (CHT) compared to those not. Methods: Transgender individuals (n = 913) completed a measure of depression, measures which predict psychopathology (self-esteem, victimization, social support, interpersonal problems), and information regarding CHT use. Participants were matched by age and experienced gender with adults from the general population who had completed the measure of depression. Results: Individuals were categorized as having no, possible or probable depressive disorder. Transgender individuals not on CHT had a nearly four-fold increased risk of probable depressive disorder, compared to controls. Older age, lower self-esteem, poorer interpersonal function and less social support predicted depressive disorder. Use of CHT was associated with less depression. Limitations: Participants were attending a national gender identity service and therefore represent only a sub-group of transgender people. Due to the cross-sectional design, longitudinal research is required to fully confirm the finding that CHT use reduces depression. Conclusion: This study confirms that non-treated transgender individuals have an increased risk of a depressive disorder. Interventions offered alongside gender affirming treatment to develop interpersonal skills, increase self-esteem and improve social support may reduce depression and prepare individuals for a more successful transition.},

The disproportionate and worsening burden of HIV and other STIs among MSM requires an urgent re-assessment of what we have been doing as a nation to reduce these infections, how we have been doing it, and the scale of our efforts.

Loneliness was measured by the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. The secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, and insomnia) were measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Appointments attendance data were extracted from a computerised medical record system. Sociodemographic factors associated with outcome changes were examined by linear regression and generalised estimating equations.ResultsData were collected from 583 older ({$\geq$}60 years) adults. There were significant increases in loneliness, anxiety, and insomnia, after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Missed medical appointments over a 3-month period increased from 16.5\% 1 year ago to 22.0\% after the onset of the outbreak. In adjusted analysis, being female, living alone, and having \&gt;4 chronic conditions were independently associated with increased loneliness. Females were more likely to have increased anxiety and insomnia.ConclusionPsychosocial health of older patients with multimorbidity markedly deteriorated and missed medical appointments substantially increased after the COVID-19 outbreak.},

From 1356 articles screened, 20 articles met inclusion criteria. Across the articles, we identified and codified 31 resilience resources: socioeconomic (e.g., employment), behavioral coping strategies (e.g., mental health treatment), cognitions/emotions (e.g., acceptance), and relationships. Resilience resources were generally associated with lower HIV risk; there were 18 low-risk associations, 4 high-risk associations, 8 non-significant associations). We generated a set of empirically based resilience variables and a hypothesis to be evaluated further to improve HIV prevention.},

First, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated in everyone living with HIV at any CD4 cell count. Second, the use of daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended as a prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of combination prevention approaches. The first of these recommendations is based on evidence from clinical trials and observational studies released since 2013 showing that earlier use of ART results in better clinical outcomes for people living with HIV compared with delayed treatment. The second recommendation is based on clinical trial results confirming the efficacy of the ARV drug tenofovir for use as PrEP to prevent people from acquiring HIV in a wide variety of settings and populations. The recommendations in this guideline will form part of the revised consolidated guidelines on the use of ARV drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection to be published by WHO in 2016. The full update of the guidelines will consist of comprehensive clinical recommendations together with revised operational and service delivery guidance to support implementation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The sequelae of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) includes HIV infection, engagement in HIV risk behaviors, substance misuse, and intimate partner violence (IPV). Although Black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately infected with HIV in the U.S.-especially in urban locations such as New York City-there is limited research with larger samples of Black MSM of varied HIV status regarding the prevalence of CSA and the potential negative consequence with respect to a "syndemic," i.e., the co-occurrence of adverse conditions such as HIVrisk, substance misuse, and IPV. METHODS: Black MSM (N = 1,002) recruited in New York City from 2009-2015 completed a screening assessment eliciting self-reported data on age, CSA, self-reported HIV status, number of male sexual partners, number of acts of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), substance misuse, and IPV. Hypothesis testing utilized logistic and linear regression models with self-reported data on CSA (independent variable) and indicators of the following syndemic factors: HIV risk, substance misuse, and IPV. RESULTS: More than one-fourth (28.1\%) met criteria for experiencing CSA. CSA was associated with significantly greater odds of being HIV-positive (AOR = 1.5; 95\% CI = 1.1-2.0); number of male sexual partners (b = 2.0, SE = 0.5, p = .002) and condomless acts of anal intercourse (b = 4.3, SE = 1.6, p = .007); odds of binge drinking (AOR = 1.5; 95\% CI = 1.1-2.0) and illicit substance use (AOR = 1.5; 95\% CI = 1.1-2.0); and odds of experiencing current IPV (AOR = 1.7; 95\% CI = 1.2-2.3). CSA was associated with significantly greater odds of concurrently experiencing 2 or more syndemic factors (AOR = 2.0, 95\% CI = 1.4-2.9, p {$<$} .001); concurrently experiencing 2 or more syndemic factors was significantly associated with having a riskier HIV status (for being HIV-positive: AOR = 1.5, 95\% CI = 1.1-2.1, p = .02; for having an unknown HIV status: AOR = 3.7, 95\% CI = 1.9-12.9, p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Among Black MSM, CSA is a prevalent problem and is a significant antecedent to HIV, substance misuse, and IPV indicators and risk. Addressing CSA may be a valuable approach to remedy the syndemic of HIV, substance misuse, and violence that has burdened MSM, especially Black MSM, in the U.S.},

  abstract = {Background: HIV, substance misuse, and partner violence (PV) have long been characterized as a syndemic - interacting and reinforcing epidemics - among key populations such as drug-involved women and female sex workers. There is a nascent recognition of PV as part of the syndemic among MSM, but there is very limited research specifically focused on the key population of Black men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: A sample of adult Black MSM (N = 1043) completed a screening assessment for a randomized clinical trial of couple-based HIV intervention for Black MSM in New York City. Respondents provided self-reported data on experiencing and perpetrating PV (CTS2 supplemented with gay- and HIV-specific forms of PV), and the following outcome variables: self-reported HIV status, number of male sexual partners, condomless anal intercourse (CAI), and substance misuse. We tested hypotheses that PV would be significantly associated with more adverse levels of each outcome variable. Results: Table 1 presents prevalence for PV among the sample by type, experiencing versus perpetration, and lifetime versus past 30 days ('current'); 38.3\% and 23.2\% experienced lifetime and current PV respectively, and 39.2\% and 23.5\% reported lifetime and currently perpetrating PV respectively. Hypotheses were validated for currently experiencing PV and perpetrating PV as follows: not knowing one's HIV status (AOR = 5.1, 95\% CI = 2.1 to 11.7 and AOR = 3.2, 95\% CI = 1.4 to 7.3 respectively); greater number of male sexual partners ([beta] = 3.6, 95\% CI = 2.6 to 4.6 and [beta] = 3.1, 95\% CI = 2.1 to 4.1 respectively); greater number of CAI ([beta] = 6.4, 95\% CI = 2.9 to 9.8 and [beta] = 3.7, 95\% CI = 0.3 to 7.2 respectively); binge drinking (AOR = 2.1, 95\% CI = 1.6 to 2.9 and AOR = 2.1, 95\% CI = 1.5 to 2.8 respectively); and illicit substance use (AOR = 2.5, 95\% CI = 1.6 to 4.1 and AOR = 3.4, 95\% CI = 2.1 to 5.6 respectively). While physical and sexual PV associations were stronger for HIV status, gay-related PV associations were larger for sexual risk behaviors. Conclusions: The high rates of PV and its multiple associations with HIV risks and substance misuse found in this study underscore the urgent need to address PV as a central factor in the syndemic that underlies Black MSM being and remaining a key, HIV-affected population. Behavioral aspects of combination prevention need to address PV - paying particular attention to gay-specific forms of PV - in order to reduce the HIV and health disparities experienced by Black MSM.},

The results revealed no significant difference in the prevalence of child sexual abuse between homosexual and bisexual people for both sexes. The prevalence of child sexual abuse among female sexual minorities was significantly higher than that among male sexual minorities. The lowest prevalence was found in South America, followed by Asia. The definition of child sexual abuse, dimension used to measure sexual orientation, year of data collection, and the mean age of participants at the time of assessment influenced the estimated prevalence of child sexual abuse. We conclude that many variables influence the reported prevalence of child sexual abuse among sexual minorities.},

  abstract = {\textbf{Introduction}: Transgender persons are at increased risk of HIV infection and would benefit from pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use. However, barriers to healthcare and a lack of data regarding PrEP efficacy among transgender persons limits use. A related issue is whether a drug-drug interaction (DDI) exists between gender affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) and PrEP. Recently, small pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to assess this interaction. \textbf{Areas covered}: This review will assess the pharmacology of PrEP agents, existing data regarding potential DDIs between GAHT and PrEP, and hypothetical mechanisms for these DDIs. A summary will be provided on implications for PrEP use among transgender persons. \textbf{Expert opinion}: Theoretically, DDIs are not expected between GAHT and PrEP. However, among transgender women (TGW) on GAHT, small studies identified a minor DDI between GAHT and tenofovir/emtricitabine (TFV/FTC), with TFV/FTC exposures \textasciitilde 12-27\% lower among TGW vs. cisgender men. The mechanism of DDIs is unclear and requires further study. For perspective, median TFV/FTC concentrations were still within the range of median concentrations reported across controlled pharmacokinetic studies. TFV-disphosphate/FTC-triphosphate concentrations were similar between TGW and cisgender men. In summary, TDF/FTC likely reaches protective concentrations and should continue to be offered as PrEP for transgender persons.},

However, the implementation of PrEP interventions outside of clinical trials has been slow and faces considerable barriers. The aim of the current study was to qualitatively explore PrEP-related patient-reported outcomes (PRO) among MSM patients who enrolled in a PrEP program at two public STD clinics in Baltimore. We conducted in-depth interviews with 18 PrEP patients who self-identified as MSM at two Baltimore City Health Department STD clinics between March and November, 2017. A codebook was developed using an iterative process. During analysis, the study team identified various biomedical and psychosocial PrEP-related PRO among MSM PrEP patients. In addition to HIV prevention, PrEP-related PRO included greater peace of mind, better continuity in care and awareness about health and well-being, relationship solidarity with serodiscordant partners, and access to social services. These findings on PrEP-related PRO can potentially contribute to improving patient-provider communication, leading to increased engagement in care and uptake of PrEP by MSM.},

  abstract = {The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's safety profile.Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 {$\mu$}M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 {$\mu$}M) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.},

Eighteen individuals were recruited through advertising in sexual health centres and through subsequent snowball sampling. Thematic interpretive analysis and inductive reasoning were used to find individual and shared group meanings. We found that HIV formed the contextual ground on which sexual decision-making was made, with three main themes emerging during interviews: 1) bacterial STI transience being contrasted against HIV permanence; 2) syphilis being 'dirty' versus HIV carrying significant stigma, though being spared the label of uncleanliness; and 3) the role of pleasure and intimacy in sexual health decision-making. Based on these findings, we recommend further exploration to develop more effective strategies around syphilis prevention, in particular with regards to the longer-term illness ramifications and its relationship to HIV transmission.},

We compared birth outcomes among women initiating dolutegravir-based ART with those among women initiating efavirenz-based ART in pregnancy in Botswana. Methods: In this observational study, we captured birth outcome data at eight government hospitals throughout Botswana (\textasciitilde 45\% of all deliveries in the country) in an ongoing study that started on Aug 15, 2014. In 2016, Botswana changed first-line ART from efavirenz-tenofovir-emtricitabine to dolutegravir-tenofovir-emtricitabine, including for pregnant women. This analysis includes women starting either efavirenz-based ART or dolutegravir-based ART during singleton pregnancy (regimen started and delivery occurring between Aug 15, 2014, and Aug 15, 2016, for efavirenz-based ART and between Nov 1, 2016, and Sept 30, 2017, for dolutegravir-based ART). We excluded births to mothers who had switched regimen or stopped ART. The primary outcomes were the combined endpoints of any adverse outcome (stillbirth, preterm birth [{$<$}37 weeks' gestation], small for gestational age [SGA; less than the tenth percentile of birthweight by gestational age], or neonatal death [within 28 days of age]) and severe adverse outcomes (stillbirth, neonatal death, very preterm birth [{$<$}32 weeks' gestation], and very SGA [less than the third percentile of birthweight by gestational age]). We fitted log-binomial regression models, controlling for maternal age, gravidity, and education, to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs). Findings: Our analysis included 1729 pregnant women who initiated dolutegravir-based ART and 4593 who initiated efavirenz-based ART. The risk for any adverse birth outcome among women on dolutegravir versus efavirenz was similar (33{$\cdot$}2\% vs 35{$\cdot$}0\%; aRR 0{$\cdot$}95, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}88\textendash 1{$\cdot$}03), as was the risk of any severe birth outcome (10{$\cdot$}7\% vs 11{$\cdot$}3\%; 0{$\cdot$}94, 0{$\cdot$}81\textendash 1{$\cdot$}11). We found no significant differences by regimen in the individual outcomes of stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, very preterm birth, SGA, or very SGA. Interpretation: Adverse birth outcomes were similar among pregnant women who initiated dolutegravir-based and efavirenz-based ART. Dolutegravir-based ART can be safely initiated in pregnancy.

This paper presents a review of intersex health and healthcare inequalities by evaluating research published from 2012 to 2019. In total 9181 citations were identified with 74 records screened of which 16 were included. A synthesis of results spans nine quantitative, five qualitative and two narrative reviews. Literature was searched in Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane, PsycInfo and CINAHL. People with intersex variance experience a higher incidence of anxiety, depression and psychological distress compared to the general population linked to stigma and discrimination. Progressive healthcare treatment, including support to question normative binaries of sex and gender, aids understand of somatic intersex variance and non-binary gender identity, especially when invasive treatment options are avoided or delayed until individuals are able to self-identify or provide consent to treatment. Findings support rethinking sex and gender to reflect greater diversity within a more nuanced sex-gender spectrum, although gaps in research remain around the general health profile and the healthcare experiences of people with intersex variance. More large-scale research is needed, co-produced with peers who have lived experience of intersex variation to ensure policy, education and healthcare advances with greater inclusivity and ethical accountability.},

Reasons for non-adherence include concomitant psychosocial health conditions - also known as syndemic conditions - such symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), past physical or sexual abuse, intimate partner violence (IPV), stimulant use, and binge drinking. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between syndemic conditions and medication adherence. The sample included 281 older men living with HIV who have sex with men (MSM). The study period was December 2012-July 2016. We observed the following syndemic conditions significantly decreased medication adherence: symptoms of depression (p = .008), PTSD (p = .002), and stimulant use (p {$<$} .0001). Past physical or sexual abuse, IPV, and binge drinking were not significantly associated with decreased medication adherence. The findings suggest that syndemic conditions may impact medication adherence in older MSM living with HIV.},

  abstract = {African American men are disproportionately affected by, not only HIV/AIDS, but also chronic non-communicable diseases. Despite the known benefits of physical activity for reducing chronic non-communicable diseases, scant research has identified factors that may influence physical activity in this population. A growing literature centers on the syndemic theory, the notion that multiple adverse conditions interact synergistically, contributing to excess morbidity. This secondary data analysis examined two primary questions: whether syndemic conditions prospectively predicted physical activity, and whether, consistent with the syndemic theory, syndemic conditions interacted to predict physical activity. Participants were 595 African American men who have sex with men (MSM), a population underrepresented in health research, enrolled in a health-promotion intervention trial from 2008-2011. We used generalized-estimating-equations models to test the associations of syndemic conditions and resilience factors measured pre-intervention to self-reported physical activity 6 and 12 months post-intervention. As hypothesized, reporting more syndemic conditions pre-intervention predicted reporting less physical activity 6 and 12 months post-intervention, adjusting for the intervention. However, contrary to the syndemic theory, we did not find evidence for the interaction effects of syndemic conditions in predicting physical activity. Receiving high school education and having greater social network diversity predicted more physical activity whereas older age predicted less physical activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the syndemic theory in relation to physical activity. Although reporting a greater number of syndemic conditions was related to reduced physical activity, there was no evidence for synergy among syndemic conditions.},

The transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a promising inhibitory effect. However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It has a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is cheaper and more readily available in China. We herein strongly urge that clinical trials are performed to assess the preventive effects of HCQ in both disease infection and progression.},

  abstract = {Research indicates that marriage equality legislation is associated with improved mental health outcomes for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people. However, the public debate that often precedes such legislation may exacerbate psychological distress and minority stress. In 2017, the Australian Federal Government conducted a national survey to gauge support for marriage equality. The present study investigated the mental health of a sample of LGBTQ people during and after this survey period. A sample of 2,220 LGBTQ participants completed measures of psychological distress and minority stress during the survey period. Participants were invited for follow-up 1 week, 3 months, and 12 months after the postal survey results were announced. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models to evaluate change in psychological distress and minority stress across time points, and the influence of exposure to the marriage equality debate, sexual identity, and gender identity on psychological distress and minority stress. Reported symptoms of psychological distress and minority stress significantly decreased following the postal survey period. Greater exposure to the marriage equality campaign was associated with greater psychological distress and perceived stigma but not internalized stigma. Sexual and gender identity subgroups significantly differed on outcome variable means. This study documents the longitudinal effects on a minority group of a public vote and the enactment of legislation regarding their human rights. The results suggest the postal survey served as a significant stressor to Australia's LGBTQ community. Implications for policy and clinical practice are discussed.

  doi = {10.1037/sgd0000439},
  abstract = {The minority stress model describes the unique stressors that impact sexual and gender minorities above and beyond general stressors and includes both external (distal) and internal (proximal) sources of stress. Proximal stressors are the thoughts and feelings that are elicited and maintained because of direct and indirect experiences with prejudice events and are typically conceptualized to include anticipated stigma, internalized transphobia, and gender identity concealment. Recently, gender dysphoria has been proposed as a proximal stressor due to its interactive nature with both external triggers and mental health symptoms. However, gender dysphoria has not been tested empirically in prior published models of gender minority stress. Trans and nonbinary participants ({$<$}em{$>$}N{$<$}/em{$>$} = 297) over the age of 18 were recruited via postings on social networking websites. Participants identified as trans feminine ({$<$}em{$>$}n{$<$}/em{$>$} = 128), trans masculine ({$<$}em{$>$}n{$<$}/em{$>$} = 110), nonbinary ({$<$}em{$>$}n{$<$}/em{$>$} = 49), and agender ({$<$}em{$>$}n{$<$}/em{$>$} = 10), and ranged in age from 18 to 67 ({$<$}em{$>$}M{$<$}/em{$>$} = 28, {$<$}em{$>$}SD{$<$}/em{$>$} = 9.42). Through a confirmatory factor analysis, it was shown that internalized transphobia, anticipated stress, gender identity concealment, and gender dysphoria reflect the latent factor proximal stress. Findings from this study suggest that gender dysphoria should be understood as a proximal stressor. As such, clinical interventions that target how individuals internalize experiences in a cisnormative society could have a positive impact on the severity of gender dysphoria. Additionally, modeling gender dysphoria as a proximal stressor can help future research disaggregate gender dysphoria from negative mental health symptoms such as anxiety or rumination.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Syndemics consider where two or more conditions cluster, how they interact, and what macro-social processes have driven them together. Yet, syndemics emerge and interact differently across contexts and through time. This article considers how syndemics involving type 2 diabetes (DM), disability, and income differ among men and women and between India and China. We use the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) data. Using multivariable logistic regression, we assess the interaction of socio-economic factors and diseases on a multiplicative scale. We found that gender and income interact significantly in China to increase the odds of reporting hypertension and diabetes, but only for reporting diabetes in India. High income interacts with metabolic conditions to increase the odds of reporting comorbidity. Hypertension and diabetes were both independently and jointly associated with increase in the odds of being disabled in both countries, but the association varies by conditions. We argue that, first, our study reveals how these syndemics differ between countries and, second, that they differ significantly between income groups. Both findings refute the idea that a "global syndemic" exists. Instead, we emphasize the need for more ethnographic work that invests in local historical, social, and political interpretations of syndemics. Furthermore, ethnographic evidence suggests that the lowest-income communities face compounded social stress, untreated depression, and poor healthcare access alongside these clustered "metabolic" conditions. This point is most notable to demonstrate the need for chronic integrated care for not only the wealthy but also poorer people with metabolic conditions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Further, BMSM-SW have been shown to have higher rates of syndemic psychosocial health conditions which contribute to HIV risk behavior and incidence, and poorer care outcomes than other groups of men who have sex with men. However, syndemic perspectives have not been applied to understanding past-year STI burden among BMSM-SW in the U.S. Sexually active Black MSM\,{$\geq$}\,18~years old were recruited from Black Pride events in six U.S. cities (\emph{n}\,=\,4421) between 2014 and 2017. Multivariable logistic regressions assessed correlates of past-year sex work engagement; whether BMSM-SW had higher odds of syndemic conditions; and whether BMSM-SW had higher odds of self-reported, past-year STI diagnoses. Structural equation models assessed relationships between sex work engagement, syndemic conditions, and STI controlled for sociodemographics and number of sexual partners. A total of 254 (5.7\%) Black MSM reported past-year sex work, of whom 45.3\% were HIV positive. BMSM-SW were significantly more likely to be Hispanic, to report past-year bisexual behavior, and to report annual income\,\&lt;\,\$10,000. In multivariable models, BMSM-SW were significantly more likely to report intimate partner violence, assault victimization, polydrug use, and depression symptoms; they were also more likely to report past-year gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. Syndemic conditions mediated the relationship between past-year sex work and past-year STI burden, constituting a significant indirect effect. BMSM-SW in the U.S. face severe biopsychosocial health disparities. Interventions developed for BMSM engaged in sex work are lacking. Our results suggest that interventions containing safer sex work education and sex-positive biobehavioral HIV/STI prevention alongside substance use, mental health, employment, and education components will be most effective.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is safe and efficacious to prevent persistent HPV infection, precancerous anogenital lesions and cervical cancer. However, in countries where vaccination programmes are implemented outside of schools, such as France, reaching high HPV vaccination coverage of the target population is challenging. Many studies have been performed in France to assess cognitions of general practitioners' (GPs) regarding HPV vaccination. However, the evidence is not consistent about which cognitions are key. To provide a comprehensive overview, we performed a systematic review of studies conducted in France on GPs' cognitions regarding HPV vaccination and used the reasoned action approach to extract and synthesize data. The systematic search was performed up to July 2020 in Medline via PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, Pascal and Francis databases. Grey literature was searched for in the French Public Health Database, Cairn. Info, {$<$}a href="http://yahoo.fr"{$>$}yahoo.fr{$<$}/a{$>$}, and Google Scholar. Twenty-five scientific publications were selected based on eligibility criteria and assessed for quality. Our qualitative synthesis highlights that although 73\% of GPs report recommending HPV vaccination, up to 50\% would not recommend it because of concerns, including changes in patients' health behaviours and doubts about safety and/or efficacy. GPs' injunctive norms, i.e. trust in institutional information, were shown to be associated positively with GPs' willingness to recommend HPV vaccination. Parents' fears, girls' age, and potential connection with sexuality do not seem to affect GPs' recommendations. These results will inform the development of a professional educational intervention targeting GPs in France.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

While a trans affirming model is used across Australian paediatric gender clinics, this does not automatically mean that all transgender young people and their parents experience the care they receive as affirming. This article considers the experiences and views of transgender young people (aged 11\textendash 17) and their parents in relation to healthcare professionals inside and outside of gender clinics in Australia. Ten qualitative interviews were conducted with parent\textendash child dyads in two Australian states. Key themes relating to healthcare professionals were: differing levels of healthcare professional knowledge and affirmation, quality of service is dependent on individual healthcare professionals, and lack of connected services and referral pathways. The discussion explores specific issues arising from the findings that suggest implications for training for healthcare professionals so as to be better equipped to provide trans affirming clinical care.},

Research on IPV in heterosexual couples, in particular on heterosexual women, has been prolific. However, there is a dearth of literature to document the distinct experiences of gay and bisexual men, despite the evidence of prevalence of IPV as reported equal or higher to heterosexual women. Studies have found that one in four gay men and four in 10 bisexual men have experienced IPV in their lifetime. This scoping review examines studies between 1931 and 2019 that had a predominant focus on violence among gay and bisexual men. Four electronic databases were searched in 2019. Arksey and O'Malley's framework was utilized to extract 28 studies using a range of research designs that represented 13,224 sexual minority male participants. Across studies, gay and bisexual men were observed to experience IPV similarly to heterosexual couples involving psychological, physical, and sexual violence. However, as a marginalized and sexual minority group, they experience distinctive features of violence including sexual orientation outing, unprotected sexual intercourse, homophobia, internalized homophobia, and difficulties accessing minority men\textendash focused services. Minority stress theory is posited as a useful lens in understanding the above features. In keeping with previous scholarship, a paucity of knowledge on gay and bisexual men's experience of IPV was observed, and additional research is recommended.},

Significant interactions across age of experience of CSA were found for alcohol problems, cannabis problems, and condomless anal sex partners. Consistent with previous literature, this analysis found CSA to be a significant influence on various health outcomes. No single explanatory framework emerged; however, adolescent exposures may be more closely linked to health outcomes and risk behaviors than pre-teenage or cumulative exposures.},

Network analysis allowed us to visualize the comorbidity structure of NSSI-D and BPD on a symptom-level and revealed which bridge symptoms connected both disorders. Our results supported NSSI-D as significantly distinct from, yet closely related to, BPD in adolescents. Even though girls were more likely to meet the NSSI-D criteria, our findings suggested that the manner in which NSSI-D and BPD symptoms were interconnected, did not differ between girls and boys. Furthermore, loneliness, impulsivity, separation anxiety, frequent thinking about NSSI, and negative affect prior to NSSI were detected as prominent bridge symptoms between NSSI-D and BPD. These bridge symptoms could provide useful targets for early intervention in and prevention of the development of comorbidity between NSSI-D and BPD.

A systematic review was conducted of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and LGBT Life bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed scientific studies with non-HIV chronic disease prevalence data for transgender populations published any date up to February 15, 2019 without restriction on country or study design.

The empirical literature on chronic disease among global transgender populations focuses on mental health morbidity, demonstrating an evidence gap on chronic physical health morbidity, particularly beyond that of sexual health. This review identified important gaps including in age-related conditions, inflammation-related disease and studies designed explicitly to investigate chronic disease burden among transgender populations.

While research indicates the benefits of providing gender affirming hormone therapy through interdisciplinary primary care-based models, less is known about how service users and providers construct their understandings of affirmative approaches. In this paper, we present findings from a discourse analysis of four service users' and four healthcare professionals' talk about a primary care-based pilot clinic providing gender affirming hormone therapy in Aotearoa New Zealand. Participants employed notions of pathologisation, time, and agency in their talk to construct the clinic as a personal setting which gave service users time to make their own health decisions, while constructing hospitals as impersonal with lengthy wait times. The assessment-driven nature of best practice guidelines that governed clinicians' decision-making was constructed as constraining users' agency. Findings highlight the ongoing importance of aligning gender affirming hormone therapy with other non-disease types of healthcare, and suggest new ways for achieving this through affirmative approaches to healthcare.},

  doi = {10.1093/ckj/sfz152},
  abstract = {The choice of gender to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in transgender persons may have a profound impact on clinical decision making and care [{$<$}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr" href=""{$>$}1{$<$}/a{$>$}]. However, few physicians are aware of this fact. In gender- and creatinine-based eGFR equations, gender is a surrogate for muscle mass [{$<$}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr" href=""{$>$}2{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Thus, even though there are no official guidelines to deal with the issue, it seems reasonable to choose the gender in the equation based on the individual's actual muscle mass rather than on the current administrative or self-identity gender, or better still, to measure GFR in clinical situations where a precise value is required [{$<$}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr" href=""{$>$}3{$<$}/a{$>$}]. In this regard, transgender female creatinine values resemble male ones [{$<$}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr" href=""{$>$}4{$<$}/a{$>$}]. We report a 40-year-old female referred to nephrology for a sudden 'decrease' in eGFR that could be traced to the gender change in administrative records. Over recent years her serum creatinine had ranged from 0.90 to 1.03\,mg/dL and eGFR from 100 to 112\,mL/min/1.73\,m\textsuperscript{2}. However, in April 2019, serum creatinine was 0.93\,mg/dL but, surprisingly, eGFR had dropped to 77\,mL/min/1.73\,m\textsuperscript{2} according to Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation ({$<$}a class="link link-reveal link-table xref-fig" href=""{$>$}Figure~1{$<$}/a{$>$}). Discussion of the issue with the patient disclosed that she was a transgender female and had been on hormone therapy (cyproterone and estradiol) for 10 years, although this was not reflected in the electronic clinical records. A recent change in gender in the hospital administrative records resulted in a change in the automated equation to calculate eGFR from male to female. Indeed, the CKD-EPI 'male' eGFR remained stable at 103\,mL/min/1.73\,m\textsuperscript{2} and 24-h creatinine clearance was 122\,mL/min. The topic of GFR estimation in transgender persons is not addressed in recent guidelines [{$<$}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr" href=""{$>$}5{$<$}/a{$>$}], and the lack of understanding by primary care physicians or specialists of the issues involved may potentially lead to unnecessary and even potentially invasive diagnostic procedures. A closer integration of the administrative, clinical biochemistry and clinical levels of care may decrease the possibility of harm by creating physician alerts triggered by recent changes in gender in administrative records, which provide information on potential biochemical implications.},

We examined the pandemic's impact on an established longitudinal cohort of TGNB individuals (\emph{N} =~208) by administering an online survey between March-June 2020. We used multivariable linear regression to examine reduced LGBTQ/TGNB community support and disruptions in gender-affirming health care as predictors of psychological distress during the pandemic. We found that the pandemic exacerbated ongoing mental health disparities for TGNB individuals. Furthermore, reduced LGBTQ/TGNB support was associated with increased psychological distress during the pandemic. Interruption and/or delay in gender-affirming health care was not associated with increased psychological distress during the pandemic. Special attention is needed to address the unique ways in which TGNB individuals were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTIONDoes gender-affirming treatment prevent full spermatogenesis in transgender women (TW)?SUMMARY ANSWERAdequate hormonal therapy (HT) leads to complete suppression of spermatogenesis in most TW, if serum testosterone levels within female reference ranges are obtained.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYGender-affirming treatment in transgender individuals may involve gender-affirming HT. The effects on spermatogenesis in TW remain unclear. In order to add information from a referral centre for transgender care, we wish to compare results of earlier studies with our population of TW who received a standard hormone treatment.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONThis was a prospective cohort study part of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence (ENIGI), conducted between 15 February 2010 and 30 September 2015. There were 162 TW were included in the ENIGI study at the Ghent University Hospital in Belgium. Participants are included in ENIGI when they first start HT, and follow-up visits occur over the next 3\,years.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING METHODSThe study included 97 TW who initiated HT with cyproterone acetate (CPA) plus oestrogens and proceeded with gonadectomy at the Ghent University Hospital. Testicular tissue retrieved during gonadectomy was processed and stained for four different germ cell markers by the Biology of the Testis lab at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Subsequent immunohistochemical staining was performed for melanoma-associated antigen A4 (MAGE-A4, marker for spermatogonia and early spermatocytes), boule homologue, RNA-binding protein (BOLL, marker for secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids), cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM, marker for round spermatids) and acrosin (marker for acrosome visualization). Serum levels of sex steroids were measured prior to surgery.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCESuppressed testosterone levels (\&lt;50\,ng/dl) were found in 92\% of the participants prior to surgery. The mean time between initiation of HT and surgery was 685\,days. In 88\% (85/97) of the sections, MAGE-A4 staining was positive. Further staining could not reveal complete spermatogenesis in any participant.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONTesticular function of the participants prior to initiation of HT was not assessed, although all participants presented with cisgender male serum testosterone values before initiation of HT. The current study only reports on people using CPA at a fixed dose and may therefore not be applicable to all TW.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSHT leads to complete suppression of spermatogenesis in most TW, if serum testosterone levels within female reference ranges are obtained. Serum testosterone levels are associated with the sperm maturation rate. It is important to discuss sperm preservation before the start of hormone therapy. If serum testosterone levels remain higher, spermatogenesis may still occur.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)D.V.S. is a post-doctoral fellow of the Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO; 12M2819N). Processing of the testis specimens was funded by the Biology of The Testes (BITE) research group (Department of Reproduction, Genetics and Regenerative medicine at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)).

Measuring the client's self-perception of their communication experiences is crucial for providing client-centered services and measuring outcomes. However, there is currently no validated assessment tool for the nonbinary population, a part of the transgender population. This study explores the voice-related concerns and experiences among the nonbinary population to create a valid measure of their self-perception of voice. Ten nonbinary individuals were surveyed about their voice-related concerns and experiences. A thematic analysis of the responses led to the development of the questionnaire, titled the Voice-related Experiences of Nonbinary Individuals. The questionnaire was systematically evaluated for its content validity by a panel of speech-language pathologist experts in transgender voice services. Outcomes of this analysis supported the measure's content validity and motivated further revisions. This is the first assessment tool that measures self-perception of voice and voice-related experiences for nonbinary individuals. Initial psychometric testing supported its content validity and further research is needed for large-scale testing of validity and reliability.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Different guidelines mention a severe risk of liver injury within the first months after the start of treatment with anabolic androgenic steroids, antiandrogens, and oral contraceptives, which is potentially fatal. Objective: The incidence of liver injury in a transgender population using gender-affirming hormone therapy. Design: Multicentre prospective study with 1933 transgender individuals, who started with hormone therapy between 2010 and 2020.  Methods: The following parameters were analysed before hormone therapy, after 3 months, and after 12 months of hormone therapy: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Both male and female reference values were considered. Liver injury was defined as either an elevation of 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) of ALP, 3xULN of ALT, or 3x ULN of AST. Results: 889 transgender women and 1044 transgender men were included in the analysis. The incidence of liver injury within 12 months after start of hormone therapy, without attribution to alcohol abuse, medical history, or co medication was 0.1\% and 0.0\% in transgender women according to female and male reference intervals respectively, and 0.6\% and 0.4\% in transgender men (female and male reference intervals). Conclusion: The incidence of liver injury is found to be very low. We therefore conclude that liver enzyme monitoring within the frame of the risk of liver injury due to hormone therapy is not necessary in a transgender population.},

We discuss two patient cases, one transgender man and one transgender woman who present for routine medical care, to review several conditions that may be impacted by the hormones utilized in masculinizing and feminizing GAHT and for which screening recommendations are available for TGD adults: cardiovascular risk factors, osteoporosis, breast cancer, cervical cancer, and prostate cancer. We reviewed the TGD-specific screening recommendations from several major medical organizations and programs and found them to be largely based upon expert opinion due to a lack of evidence. The goal of this narrative review is to assist healthcare professionals in counseling and screening their TGD patients when and where appropriate. Not all TGD adults have the ability or need to receive routine medical care from a specialized TGD health clinic; therefore, it is essential for all healthcare professionals involved in routine and gender-affirming care to have knowledge about these conditions and screenings.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health problem that has become a crisis fuelled by HIV and the increasing occurrence of antimicrobial resistance. What has been termed the biosocial nature of TB challenges effective control of the disease. Yet, biosocial interactions involved in the persistence of TB in diverse settings are difficult to systematically account for. The recently developed framework of syndemics provides a way to capture how complex health problems result from the interactions between diseases such as HIV and TB, and harmful social conditions such as unemployment, malnutrition and substance abuse. This article advances the syndemics scholarship by examining health conditions that cluster together with TB in the Russian Federation, by eliciting a set of social processes that precipitate this clustering and exacerbate health outcomes, and by analysing interactions between these health conditions and social processes. To provide an account of this complexity, the article takes a qualitative approach and draws on the perspectives and experiences of people with TB. The results demonstrate emergence of a syndemic of stress, substance abuse, TB and HIV that is sustained by poverty, occupational insecurity, marginalization and isolation. Frictions between the narrow focus of the health care system on TB and the wider syndemic processes in which the lives of many persons with TB are embedded, contribute to poorer health outcomes and increase the risks of developing drug resistance. Finally, the article argues that the large-scale and impersonal forces become embodied as individual pathology through the crucial interface of the ways in which persons experience and make sense of these forces and pathologies. Qualitative research is needed for the adequate analysis of this biosocial complexity in order to provide a solid basis for responses to TB-centred syndemics in various settings.},
