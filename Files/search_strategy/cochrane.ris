N2  - Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to bear a disproportionate burden of the sexually transmitted infections (STI), such as HIV in Canada, largely attributable to efficient transmission during condomless anal sex (CAS). Despite overall declines in HIV incidence since 2005, HIV incidence among MSM remains stable. In 2016, MSM accounted for 52.5% of new HIV diagnoses in Canada, compared with 56.8% in 2014. MSM also represent over half of all prevalent HIV cases. The HIV epidemic among MSM has failed to decline despite biomedically-driven efforts to reduce infectiousness through the proliferation of antiretroviral Treatment as Prevention, and the emergence of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce HIV susceptibility. The epidemiologic data underscore the need for efficacious interventions for reducing sexual risk behaviour among MSM. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has therefore identified MSM as a high priority population to reach with prevention initiatives., Social anxiety is a risk factor for CAS among MSM. It is typically defined as the experience of fear of and apprehension about being evaluated in interpersonal situations, including romantic or sexual relationships. Social anxiety is higher among gay men and other sexual minority populations than among heterosexuals on both dimensional measures and categorical measures, with recent studies reporting the prevalence of social anxiety disorders among MSM as 22.3-22.9%., Social anxiety predicts risky sex among MSM. Research suggests a direct relation between social anxiety and CAS among MSM. Social anxiety was associated with a greater proportion of receptive and insertive CAS even after adjusting for condom use negotiation, depression, and club drug use. Social anxiety may also increase substance use in sexual situations, which is another risk factor for HIV among MSM. However, no studies have examined the efficacy of social anxiety treatment on CAS among MSM. Social anxiety is highly modifiable via cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)., Fears of being sexually rejected by one's partner fully accounted for the association between social anxiety at baseline and CAS at 6-month follow-up. This study is consistent with previous findings that 32% of gay men reported being less likely to use condoms when they were concerned their partner would react negatively. Substance use may be another mediator. Social anxiety is also a risk factor for later alcohol use and other substance use problems in clinical and nonclinical samples, including among MSM. Substance use tends to follow social anxiety disorder because alcohol and other substances are used to self-medicate anxiety symptoms in social situations. Alcohol and substance use in sexual situations was a relatively consistent risk factor for CAS among Canadian MSM, as well as higher HIV incidence. Due to consistent data linking substance use to HIV risks, it has been suggested that incorporating alcohol and substance use treatment into sexual risk reduction counselling may increase the efficacy of HIV prevention efforts for MSM. Social anxiety may have a specific relationship with substance use in creating risk for HIV and other STIs., The present study will provide efficacy data for a novel and innovative STI/HIV prevention intervention for MSM. This intervention, called Sexual Confidence, builds upon empirically supported treatments for social anxiety, including social anxiety-related substance use, by adding risk reduction counselling to reduce STI/HIV sexual risk behaviour., Over the past 10 years, numerous well-designed clinical trials have established the efficacy of behavioural interventions to reduce HIV risk behaviour among HIV-negative individuals. However, the success of these programs is limited and evidence suggests these effects diminish over time. Improving the efficacy of these programs is a public health priority., The current proposal seeks to reach individuals who are at higher risk for engaging in continued HIV risk behaviour due to the presence of social anxiety and substance use in sexual situations, and who may have difficulty responding to an intervention that targets sexual risk taking alone. Research from multiple countries suggests that all MSM are not equally at risk for HIV. A preponderance of data indicates the incremental presence of co-occurring mental health and substance use problems, called syndemic, predict both HIV prevalence and HIV sexual risk behaviour among MSM. One of the largest study of MSM from 151 countries reported a strong dose-response relationship with increasing odds of HIV infection and greater number of syndemic problems. Compared with those without syndemic problems, the odds of HIV infection among those with 1, 2 and 3 or more syndemic problems were 1.67, 2.02 and 2.35 times greater respectively. The MSM in our study may account for almost half (22% of MSM who have double the risk for contracting HIV) of the HIV epidemic in Canada and beyond. Our team and others in sexual health promotion and HIV prevention have found that untreated mental health issues interfere with safer sexual practices. If the investigators wish to meet the HIV prevention needs of MSM they need to augment HIV prevention interventions by addressing the mental health problems that contribute to increased risk in this group and that impede the efficacy of traditional HIV prevention efforts., Meta-analyses suggest that behavioural interventions can be efficacious at reducing self-reported CAS among MSM. Other reviews found greater efficacy with active interventions rather than interventions where participants just receive information. In accordance with these findings, the Sexual Confidence program includes actively role-playing situations in which participants practice their safer sex negotiation skills. Given the lack of efficacious interventions designed in Canada, there is a need for rigorous empirical testing of the effects of HIV prevention interventions for Canadian MSM., Rates of Syphilis, Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea have risen among MSM, especially among HIV+ MSM living in the Canadian urban centers including Toronto. Co-infection with HIV is particularly concerning as CAS with HIV+ MSM can increase likelihood of transmission. A cohort study from the Ontario HIV Treatment Network reported a 12-month cumulative incidence of 1.7% (95% CI 1.1% to 2.2%) for chlamydia/gonorrhea, and having CAS with multiple HIV+ partners (HR=3.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 7.8) was a strong predictor of the infection., CBT focuses on reducing psychological distress and the psychosocial interference of anxiety, substance use, and other psychological problems using cognitive restructuring techniques (i.e., teaching people to think more realistically about the situations they fear) and by repeated exposure to feared situations. CBT promotes learning adaptive responses to feared stimuli and is hypothesized to facilitate cognitive changes. Although behavioural therapies such as AR and exposure therapy are also brief and efficacious interventions, only CBT has evidence supporting its use when social anxiety disorder and substance use problems are comorbid., CBT has proven to be acceptable among diverse MSM populations. A manualized format, the availability of training, and the presence of competence and adherence rating scales are additional characteristics that make CBT a feasible modality for HIV prevention programming. Lastly, the conceptual underpinnings for CBT (social cognitive theory) are shared by most other research-supported HIV risk reduction interventions., The current state of the science identifies behavioural therapies, including CBT, as the psychosocial treatment of choice for social anxiety disorder. A review of 32 RCTs reported that the average CBT treated participant scored better than 80% of the waitlist and 66% of the placebo participants, and patients continue to increase the magnitude of their treatment gains over time. Pharmacotherapy treatments fare as well as CBT although pharmacotherapy often requires continuing treatment indefinitely to prevent relapse, whereas CBT has a finite number of sessions and is associated with strong maintenance of treatment gains. There are insufficient research findings available to evaluate interpersonal psychotherapy or psychodynamic therapy as treatment options for social anxiety disorder, and these modalities were not given further consideration., Our main objective is to test the efficacy of this integrated program in reducing sexual risk behaviour using a 2-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT). Secondarily, we will compare the social anxiety, substance use in sexual situations, and the cumulative incidence of bacterial STIs between the two arms over a 9-month follow-up period. The investigators hypothesize that relative to the control condition, Sexual Confidence will reduce sexual risk behaviour, as defined by CAS with HIV-positive or unknown HIV status sexual partners without the use of PrEP. The investigators further hypothesize that Sexual Confidence will result in greater reductions in social anxiety and substance use in sexual situations., Our proposed research is a single blind, two arm randomized trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to the CBT or Applied Relaxation (AR) arm. Counsellors cannot be blinded as they are providing treatment, however assessors will be blinded to treatment condition. Participants will not be provided with details on the treatment condition to which they were not assigned to minimize the possibility that participant beliefs about which condition is better will impact outcomes., Participants will be randomly assigned to CBT, the experimental arm, or the AR arm, which serves as the control condition. Both arms are active treatment conditions; however, the investigators hypothesize that the Sexual Confidence CBT arm will have a significantly larger effect on sexual risk behaviour than the AR arm as AR does not discuss or address substance use, sexual risk reduction, or sexual behaviour., The investigators propose a conceptual model for the relationship between social anxiety, substance use, and sexual risk behaviour. The goal of the model is not to provide a comprehensive account of all direct and indirect relationships, but rather to suggest particular vulnerabilities for sexual HIV risk. This model purports that the experience of social anxiety symptoms in sexual situations generates unwanted anxious affect (e.g., fear of sexual rejection, fear of negative evaluation), which individuals are motivated to avoid. Heavy alcohol and drug consumption before or during sexual activity is the behavioural mechanism in the model in this study for avoiding the anxiety associated with social interactions. In this way, using substances to avoid socially anxious thoughts leads to risky sexual behaviour both directly and indirectly through impaired safer sex negotiation., These mechanisms are consistent with cognitive-behavioural theory. Behaviourally, substance use (and potentially risky sexual behaviour) is negatively reinforced through the avoidance of (or escape from) unwanted anxious affect. Cognitively, socially anxious predictions generate unrealistic risk appraisals of rejection that contribute to sexual risk. Sexual Confidence is designed to address these specified pathways: (a) planned exposures to learn adaptive strategies for reducing social anxiety, avoidance-motivated substance use, and avoidance-motivated sexual risk, (b) cognitive restructuring to train realistic cognitive appraisals of rejection for negotiating safer sex, and (c) risk reduction counselling to increase safer sex negotiation skills and to specify safer sex behaviour change targets.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) constitute a risk group for sexual transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. Despite counselling interventions, risk behaviour remains high. Syndemic theory holds that psychosocial problems often co-occur, interact and mutually reinforce each other, thereby increasing high risk behaviours and co-occurring diseases. Therefore, if co-occurring psychosocial problems were assessed and treated simultaneously, this might decrease high risk behaviour and disease., METHOD: An open label randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 150 MSM with high risk behaviour recruited from the STI clinic of Amsterdam. Inclusion criteria are: HIV negative MSM with two STI and/or PEP treatment in the last 24 months, or HIV positive MSM with one STI in the last 24 months. All participants get questionnaires on the following syndemic domains: ADHD, depression, anxiety disorder, alexithymia and sex- and drug addiction. Participants in the control group receive standard care: STI screenings every three months and motivational interviewing based counselling. Participants in the experimental group receive standard care plus feedback based on the results of the questionnaires. All participants can be referred to co-located mental health or addiction services. The primary outcome is help seeking behaviour for mental health problems and/or drug use problems. The secondary outcomes are STI incidence and changes in sexual risk behaviour (i.e. condom use, number of anal sex partners, drug use during sex)., DISCUSSION: This study will provide information on syndemic domains among MSM who show high risk behaviour and on the effect of screening and referral on help seeking behaviour and health (behaviour) outcomes., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial Registration at clinicaltrail.gov, identifier NCT02859935 .

N2  - To address childhood sexual abuse (CSA) related distress and HIV risk in men who have sex with men (MSM) using cognitive-behavioral therapy for trauma and self-care (CBT-TSC), which is a novel intervention integrating HIV risk reduction with modified cognitive and behavioral therapy strategies for post-traumatic stress. We compared CBT-TSC to HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)-only in an initial 2-arm RCT in 43 HIV-negative MSM at with a history of CSA and HIV risk. Serodiscordant condomless anal/vaginal sex (CAS; CAS with HIV-postive or HIV unknown status partners) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (Davidson Trauma Scale: total score and avoidance, intrusions, hyperarousal subscales) were outcomes immediately post-treatment, and at 6- and 9-month follow-up. At post-treatment, CBT-TSC had decreased odds (approximately 60%) of any CAS and greater reductions in CAS compared to VCT-only. Additionally, the CBT-TSC condition experienced greater reductions in total PTSD and avoidance symptoms. At the follow-up visits, CBT-TSC condition had significant reductions in the odds of any CAS and reductions in CAS. However, for PTSD symptoms, only the avoidance subscale remained significantly different compared to VCT-only. CBT-TSC is a potentially efficacious approach to address HIV risk in MSM with a CSA history, with replication and extension in a larger trial needed. This proof-of-concept trial is the first to integrate the treatment of a commonly occurring mental-health syndemic problem in MSM with a health psychology approach to self-care in MSM.Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01266122.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in India are a key group at risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. They are also an extremely marginalized and stigmatized population, facing immense psychosocial stressors including, but not limited to, stigma, homophobia, discrimination, criminalization, low self-esteem, low self-acceptance, distress, and, as a result, high rates of mental health problems. Although these multi-level psychosocial problems may put MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition and transmission, currently HIV prevention interventions in India do not address them. This paper describes the design of a psychosocial intervention to reduce HIV risk for MSM in India. METHODS: Funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, this study is a two-arm randomized clinical efficacy trial of a self-acceptance based psychosocial HIV prevention intervention, informed by the minority stress model and syndemic theory, that was developed with extensive community-based formative work and input from the Indian MSM community and key informants who are knowledgeable about the experiences faced by MSM in India. Participants are MSM in Chennai and Mumbai who endorsed recent sexual behaviors placing them at high risk for HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition and transmission. Enrolled participants are equally randomized to either 1) the experimental condition, which consists of four group and six individual counseling sessions and includes standard of care HIV/STI testing and counseling, or 2) the standard of care condition, which includes HIV/STI testing and counseling alone. The primary outcomes are changes in the frequency of condomless anal sex acts and STI incidence (syphilis seropositivity and urethral, rectal, and pharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia infection. Major study assessment visits occur at baseline, 4-, 8-, and 12-months. DISCUSSION: HIV prevention interventions that address the psychosocial stressors faced by MSM in India are needed; this study will examine the efficacy of such an intervention. If the intervention is successful, it may be able to reduce the national HIV/AIDS burden in India while empowering a marginalized and highly stigmatized group.

T1  - LinkPositively: a Technology-Delivered Peer Navigation and Social Networking Intervention to Improve HIV Care
T2  - LinkPositively: a Technology-Delivered Peer Navigation and Social Networking Intervention to Improve HIV Care Across the Continuum for Black Women Affected by Interpersonal Violence
A1  - NCT04199052
Y1  - 2019//
Y2  - 2019//
N2  - In the US, Black women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA) are less likely to be engaged in care, adherent to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and virally suppressed compared to White WLHA. Black women are also disproportionately affected by interpersonal violence - physical, sexual, and/or psychological abuse by a current or former intimate partner or non-intimate partner - which may co-occur with poor mental health and/or substance use, further contributing to ART non-adherence, lower CD4 counts, and reduced viral suppression. Peer Navigation, while highlighted as a successful model of care in improving HIV care outcomes, requires resources that HIV service agencies often lack. A scalable and sustainable solution is the use of mobile health (mHealth) smartphone applications ("apps"). Although there has been an increase in mHealth interventions developed for HIV prevention and care among at-risk and HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) and youth, investigators are unaware of any to improve retention in care, ART adherence, and viral suppression among Black WLHA, nor any mHealth interventions that are responsive to Black women's experiences with interpersonal violence. To address this gap, investigators will develop and pilot test a culturally tailored, trauma-informed smartphone app, called LinkPositively, for Black WLHA affected by interpersonal violence. Core components of LinkPositively include: a) Virtual Peer Navigation that includes phone and text check-ins and 4 weekly one-on-one video sessions to build skills to cope with barriers and navigate care; b) Social Networking platform to receive peer support; c) Educational and Self-care database with healthy living and self-care tips; d) GPS-enabled Resource Locator for HIV care and ancillary support service agencies; and e) ART self-monitoring and reminder system. Guided by the Theory of Triadic Influences and Syndemic Theory, the study will be conducted in 2 phases with corresponding aims. In Aim 1, 4 focus groups with Black WLHA with experiences of interpersonal violence, one focus group with peer navigators, and 4-6 key informant interviews with providers will be conducted to determine which app features, content, and functions are most likely to support downloading, initiating use, and sustaining engagement over time. Aim 1 will culminate in usability testing by Black WLHA affected by interpersonal violence (n=5), to finalize intervention components and procedures. In Aim 2, investigators will pilot test LinkPositively to assess feasibility and acceptability and determine preliminary effects of the intervention on HIV care outcomes (i.e., retention in care, ART adherence, viral suppression) and mechanism of change variables (i.e., social support, self-efficacy). Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=40) or control (Ryan White standard of care, n=40) arm, with follow-up at 3- and 6- months. This study will benefit the advancement of HIV prevention science by harnessing technology to promote engagement in HIV care, while improving social support through peers and social networking - all under the auspices of being trauma-informed for Black WLHA with experiences of interpersonal violence.

N2  - Among men who have sex with men (MSM), the largest population living with HIV in the U.S., poor self-care behaviors occur within the context of intertwined psychosocial problems, called syndemics. Important affected health behaviors include sexual transmission risk and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. In major cities, one in five MSM are living with HIV/AIDS, making these domestic MSM rates comparable to many endemic settings such as Sub-Saharan Africa. Because of antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected individuals are living with the virus longer and the population of HIV-infected MSM continues to grow., Study after study concludes that psychosocial problems/intertwined syndemics such as depression, substance abuse, and childhood sexual abuse significantly contribute to poor self-care behaviors such as sexual risk behaviors among MSM. Despite this, one reason for the modest effects of behavioral interventions for HIV is that they generally do not address the unique and varied psychosocial context of living with HIV for various risk groups. One example of a highly prevalent psychosocial problem among HIV-infected MSM is dissatisfaction with one's appearance. Body dissatisfaction is frequently syndemic to depression in HIV-infected MSM and is related to both sexual transmission risk and HAART non-adherence. Recent evidence indicates that MSM with high body dissatisfaction are 60% less likely to use condoms during anal intercourse compared to MSM with low body dissatisfaction., The goal is to study multiple health behaviors in the context of psychosocial problems among HIV-infected and uninfected MSM. This includes designing and testing interventions aimed at reducing health problems (e.g., sexual risk, medication adherence, self-care) and co-occurring mental health disorders/syndemics. In this context, the current research plan, focusing on body dissatisfaction, depression, sexual risk reduction and HAART adherence provides one example of applying this goal to a discrete syndemic-oriented intervention development research project. This has relevance for both behavioral interventions for adherence and HIV risk behavior in MSM, which may be moderated by syndemics, but also has important application for the eventual roll-out of emerging biomedical prevention interventions. For example, HIV chemoprophylaxis (pre-exposure prophylaxis; PrEP) has recently been shown to reduce HIV transmission risk in high risk MSM. If this or other biomedical interventions are adequately disseminated to the highest risk MSM, the field will likely need plans for addressing mental health and, potentially, substance use, in the context of prescribing biomedical agents.

Y2  - 2019//
N2  - Background Men who have sex with men (MSM) constitute a risk group for sexual transmitted infections(STI). Syndemic theory holds that psychosocial problems often co-occur, interact and mutually reinforce each other, thereby increasing risk behavior. We studied the prevalence of psychosocial problems and whether raising awareness of these psychosocial problems increases help seeking behavior. Methods An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted among MSM with high risk behavior recruited from the STI clinic of Amsterdam (NCT02859935). Inclusion criteria were: either two STI or PEP treatment for HIV negative MSM or one STI for HIV positive MSM in the last 24 months. The following syndemic domains were explored: alcohol, drugs and sex addiction (AUDIT, DUDIT, SCS), anxiety disorder(HADS), depression(HADS), childhood sexual abuse and partner violence. Participants received trimonthly standard STI care for one year. Additionally, the intervention group received face-to-face feedback on syndemic questionnaires. Results Between September 2016 and August 2017 155 MSM were included. Median age was 43(IQR [34-51]), and 103/ 155(66%) were HIV positive. At baseline, 37/155(24%) tested positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea or syphilis, 1/52(2%) for HIV, 138/148(93%) reported using drugs during sex in the preceding 3 months, and 51/155(33%) self-reported help seeking behavior. In total, 114/155(75%) scored positive for at least 1 questionnaire: 47/154(31%) for alcohol use disorder, 76/154(49%) for drug use disorder, 28/154(18%) for sexual compulsivity, 47/154(30%) for anxiety disorder, 26/154(17%) for depression, 17/154(11%) for sexual abuse and 12/154(8%) for partner violence. Between the intervention and control group, we found no significant difference in self-reported help seeking behavior (35% vs 24% p=0.168), or in number of partners(13 IQR[5.5-30] vs 8.5 IQR[5-15] respectively, p=0.128). Conclusion Psychosocial and addiction related problems are alarmingly high in high risk MSM, and a syndemic approach seems necessary. Preliminary results indicate that our intervention did not increase self-reported help seeking behavior. Data collection on confirmed help seeking is ongoing.

T1  - Childhood sexual abuse among Black men who have sex with men: a cornerstone of a syndemic?
A1  - Wu E
Y1  - 2018//
Y2  - 2018//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The sequelae of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) includes HIV infection, engagement in HIV risk behaviors, substance misuse, and intimate partner violence (IPV). Although Black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately infected with HIV in the U.S.-especially in urban locations such as New York City-there is limited research with larger samples of Black MSM of varied HIV status regarding the prevalence of CSA and the potential negative consequence with respect to a "syndemic," i.e., the co-occurrence of adverse conditions such as HIVrisk, substance misuse, and IPV., METHODS: Black MSM (N = 1,002) recruited in New York City from 2009-2015 completed a screening assessment eliciting self-reported data on age, CSA, self-reported HIV status, number of male sexual partners, number of acts of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), substance misuse, and IPV. Hypothesis testing utilized logistic and linear regression models with self-reported data on CSA (independent variable) and indicators of the following syndemic factors: HIV risk, substance misuse, and IPV., RESULTS: More than one-fourth (28.1%) met criteria for experiencing CSA. CSA was associated with significantly greater odds of being HIV-positive (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.0); number of male sexual partners (b = 2.0, SE = 0.5, p = .002) and condomless acts of anal intercourse (b = 4.3, SE = 1.6, p = .007); odds of binge drinking (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.0) and illicit substance use (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.0); and odds of experiencing current IPV (AOR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2-2.3). CSA was associated with significantly greater odds of concurrently experiencing 2 or more syndemic factors (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.4-2.9, p < .001); concurrently experiencing 2 or more syndemic factors was significantly associated with having a riskier HIV status (for being HIV-positive: AOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.1, p = .02; for having an unknown HIV status: AOR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.9-12.9, p = .04)., CONCLUSIONS: Among Black MSM, CSA is a prevalent problem and is a significant antecedent to HIV, substance misuse, and IPV indicators and risk. Addressing CSA may be a valuable approach to remedy the syndemic of HIV, substance misuse, and violence that has burdened MSM, especially Black MSM, in the U.S.

T1  - Partner violence: a significant part of a syndemic among Black men who have sex with men
A1  - Wu E, El-Bassel N, Gilbert L
Y1  - 2018//
Y2  - 2018//
N2  - Background: HIV, substance misuse, and partner violence (PV) have long been characterized as a syndemic - interacting and reinforcing epidemics - among key populations such as drug-involved women and female sex workers. There is a nascent recognition of PV as part of the syndemic among MSM, but there is very limited research specifically focused on the key population of Black men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: A sample of adult Black MSM (N = 1043) completed a screening assessment for a randomized clinical trial of couple-based HIV intervention for Black MSM in New York City. Respondents provided self-reported data on experiencing and perpetrating PV (CTS2 supplemented with gay- and HIV-specific forms of PV), and the following outcome variables: self-reported HIV status, number of male sexual partners, condomless anal intercourse (CAI), and substance misuse. We tested hypotheses that PV would be significantly associated with more adverse levels of each outcome variable. Results: Table 1 presents prevalence for PV among the sample by type, experiencing versus perpetration, and lifetime versus past 30 days ('current'); 38.3% and 23.2% experienced lifetime and current PV respectively, and 39.2% and 23.5% reported lifetime and currently perpetrating PV respectively. Hypotheses were validated for currently experiencing PV and perpetrating PV as follows: not knowing one's HIV status (AOR = 5.1, 95% CI = 2.1 to 11.7 and AOR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.4 to 7.3 respectively); greater number of male sexual partners ([beta] = 3.6, 95% CI = 2.6 to 4.6 and [beta] = 3.1, 95% CI = 2.1 to 4.1 respectively); greater number of CAI ([beta] = 6.4, 95% CI = 2.9 to 9.8 and [beta] = 3.7, 95% CI = 0.3 to 7.2 respectively); binge drinking (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.6 to 2.9 and AOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.5 to 2.8 respectively); and illicit substance use (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 4.1 and AOR = 3.4, 95% CI = 2.1 to 5.6 respectively). While physical and sexual PV associations were stronger for HIV status, gay-related PV associations were larger for sexual risk behaviors. Conclusions: The high rates of PV and its multiple associations with HIV risks and substance misuse found in this study underscore the urgent need to address PV as a central factor in the syndemic that underlies Black MSM being and remaining a key, HIV-affected population. Behavioral aspects of combination prevention need to address PV - paying particular attention to gay-specific forms of PV - in order to reduce the HIV and health disparities experienced by Black MSM.

T1  - Start of a syndemic based intervention to facilitate care for men who have sex with men with high risk behaviour: the syn.bas.in randomised controlled trial

N2  - Introduction Men who have sex with men (MSM) constitute a risk group for sexual transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. Despite counselling interventions, risk behaviour remains high. Syndemic theory holds that psychosocial problems often co-occur, interact and mutually reinforce each other, thereby increasing high risk behaviours and co-occurring diseases. Therefore, if co-occurring psychosocial problems were assessed and treated simultaneously, this might decrease high risk behaviour and disease. Method An open label randomised controlled trial will be conducted among 150 MSM with high risk behaviour recruited from the STI clinic of Amsterdam. Inclusion criteria are: HIV negative MSM with two STI or PEP treatment in the last 24 months or HIV positive MSM with one STI in the last 24 months. All participants get questionnaires on the following syndemic domains: ADHD (ASRS), depression (HADS), anxiety disorder(HADS), alexithymia (TAS) and sex(SCS, Kalichman) and drug addiction(DUDIT and AUDIT). Participants in the control group receive standard care for one year: STI screenings every three months and motivational interviewing based counselling. Participants in the experimental group receive standard care plus additional questionnaires depending on baseline questionnaire scores followed by feedback and referral to a co-located mental health or addiction service in case of a positive indication according to the additional questionnaires. The primary outcome is help seeking behaviour for mental health problems and/or drug use problems. The secondary outcomes are STI incidence and changes in sexual risk behaviour (i.e. condom use, number of anal sex partners, drug use during sex). Conclusion This study will provide information on syndemic domains among MSM who show high risk behaviour and on the effect of screening and referral on help seeking behaviour and health (behaviour) outcomes. Inclusion started in September 2016, on 1 December more than 60 MSM were included with this pace baseline data will be available in July 2017.

N2  - Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are a risk group for new HIV infections. Drug use among men who have sex with men is often accompanied by risky sexual behaviours. Local AIDS help centres and gay advice centres are recording an increase in drug use among MSM clients in Germany. This study examines reasons for drug use and drug use contexts for MSM, including syndemic factors and experiences of social support. Methods: The study is based on a qualitative research approach. We conducted 14 structured, in-depth interviews with substance-using MSM in three German cities. An interview guidance document was used that was developed on the basis of the syndemic approach. Data analysis was based on structured analysis of content. Results: The MSM interviewed had extensive experience of drug use, in particular amyl nitrate, amphetamines, methamphetamine, ketamine, cocaine and cannabis. The drugs were used both at parties and in connection with sexual experiences (chemsex). Twelve men said that they had an existing HIV infection at the time of the interview. The men also reported experiences of violence and discrimination because of their sexual orientation. The social networks of the MSM and dating apps are highly relevant for experiencing chemsex. Certain places in the MSM community also have an impact on drug purchase, drug consumption and chemsex sessions. Conclusions: MSM are a group that is vulnerable to psychological problems, in particular problematic drug use. This group requires specific help from drug services and AIDS support services that are orientated towards the life situation and substance use contexts of the clients. Both support systems should work together more closely and network. Furthermore, specific prevention strategies, aimed at both mental and physical well-being, should be developed for substance-using MSM. Copyright (C) 2016 The Author(s).

N2  - Though functional social support has been shown to serve as a protective factor for HIV viral load suppression in other populations, scant research has examined this relationship among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. We assessed characteristics of social support, effects of social support on HIV viral load, and moderation by social support of the relationship between psychosocial indicators of a synergistic epidemic (syndemic) and HIV viral load. We analyzed longitudinal data from HIV-positive MSM using antiretroviral therapy who were enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study between 2002 and 2009 (n = 712). First, we conducted reliability assessments of a one-item social support measure. Then, we conducted a series of generalized longitudinal mixed models to assess our research questions. Moderation was assessed using an interaction term. A three-level (low/medium/high) social support variable demonstrated high reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.75). Black and Hispanic MSM reported lower social support than their White counterparts (p <.0001). Recent sero-conversion was associated with higher social support (p <.05). Higher numbers of concomitant syndemic indicators (depression, polysubstance use, and condomless anal sex) were associated with lower social support (p <.0001). Medium and high social support levels were associated with greater viral load suppression and lower viral load means (p <.0001). Social support moderated the relationships between syndemic and HIV viral load (p <.05). HIV-positive MSM, particularly those of color, may benefit greatly from interventions that can successfully boost functional social support. Creating strengths-based interventions may also have particularly high impact among HIV-positive MSM with the highest psychosocial burdens.

N2  - Background/introduction With much speculation and anecdotal reports regarding the causal links between sexualised recreational drug use by MSM (commonly referred to as 'ChemSex') and HIV/HCV rates, there has been much demand from commissioners and researchers and practitioners to identify the extent of the problem. In 2014, one London GUM/HIV clinic launched the NHS' first targeted ChemSex clinic. This presentation includes robust data collected from 874 unique presentations in the first year of this landmark clinic. Aim(s)/objectives The objective was to satisfy the health sector's concerns about the extent of this much hyped syndemic, with qualitative and quantitative data as well as assess interventions and cohort engagement methods. Methods Targeted clinics and outreach services were established with skilled addiction staff and resourcing peer volunteers, collecting culturally and contextually appropriate behavioural trends and data. Results Data includes: * Effectiveness of certain contextually-appropriate questions re ChemSex during GUM consultation. * ARV non-adherence amongst high-risk ChemSex party-goers who favour condomless sex. * Condom use (or otherwise) and number of partners broken down to include HIV+ve MSM not on treatment. * HIV/HCV broken down to include sexual acquisition versus injecting drug use acquisition. * HCV data broken down to include number of re-infections amongst HIV-ve non-injecting drug users. Discussion/conclusion This presentation includes the data, offers examples of how this model might be adapted in other services, and incorporates some training for attendees in how to overcome fears or ignorance regarding drug use risk assessments and consultations; it also includes film footage of role play exercises for skill-building purposes.
