N2  - PURPOSE: of review This paper will review recent use of syndemic frameworks in HIV research among African-Americans., RECENT FINDINGS: Researchers have used syndemic theory in diverse African-American study populations, including MSM, cis-women, trans-women, heterosexual men and adolescents. These studies have evaluated the associations between syndemic conditions and a variety of outcomes, such as sexual behaviours, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, HIV testing, adherence to antiretroviral therapy, HIV suppression and preexposure prophylaxis use. The most frequently evaluated syndemic conditions have been depression, substance use and personal experience of abuse or violence; a few studies have included experience of incarceration and unstable housing., SUMMARY: These studies have yielded valuable insights into links between HIV-related outcomes and mental health, experience of violence and abuse, and substance use. But a key feature - and major utility - of the syndemics framework is its potential for examining not only synergistic individual-level risk factors but also the interactions with economic, political and social systems that influence these individual-level factors and thereby shape the HIV epidemic among African-Americans. Research that takes these systems into account is needed to inform policy changes that can help end the HIV epidemic in this population.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In 2020, key populations around the world still have disproportionate risks for HIV acquisition and experiencing HIV-related syndemics. This review presents current data around HIV-related syndemics among key populations globally, and on the role of intersecting stigmas in producing these syndemics in low-to-middle-income settings., RECENT FINDINGS: Sex workers, sexual and gender minorities, prisoners, and people who use drugs experience high burdens of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, viral hepatitis, and violence linked to heightened HIV-related risks or acquisition. Adverse sexual, reproductive, and mental health outcomes are also common and similarly amplify HIV acquisition and transmission risks, highlighting the need for psychosocial and reproductive health services for key populations., SUMMARY: Achieving the promise of biomedical interventions to support HIV care and prevention requires action towards addressing syndemics of HIV, and the stigmas that reproduce them, among those most marginalized globally.

N2  - For people living with HIV, lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a serious problem and frequently results in HIV disease progression. Reasons for non-adherence include concomitant psychosocial health conditions - also known as syndemic conditions - such symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), past physical or sexual abuse, intimate partner violence (IPV), stimulant use, and binge drinking. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between syndemic conditions and medication adherence. The sample included 281 older men living with HIV who have sex with men (MSM). The study period was December 2012-July 2016. We observed the following syndemic conditions significantly decreased medication adherence: symptoms of depression (p = .008), PTSD (p = .002), and stimulant use (p < .0001). Past physical or sexual abuse, IPV, and binge drinking were not significantly associated with decreased medication adherence. The findings suggest that syndemic conditions may impact medication adherence in older MSM living with HIV.

N2  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection among adults in the United States, and can cause several types of cancer. This is of particular concern for sexual minority men, as their increased risk of HIV acquisition increases risk for HPV and HPV-associated cancers, particularly when coupled with low rates of HPV vaccination. As part of a larger study of the syndemic of HIV, substance use, and mental health among young sexual minority men in New York City, we sought to explore what sexual minority men know about HPV and the HPV vaccine, along with their experiences have been communicating about the virus and vaccine. We interviewed 38 young sexual minority men with diverse sociodemographic characteristics and identified three main themes: low knowledge about HPV infection and vaccination, highly gendered misconceptions about HPV only affecting women, and lack of communication from healthcare providers about HPV. The prevalence of incorrect HPV knowledge, coupled with inadequate education and vaccination in healthcare settings, indicates a missed opportunity for HPV prevention in a high-risk and high-need population.

N2  - Social marginalization harms lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons' wellbeing in Lesotho. Socio-cultural mechanisms linking LGBT stigma, depression, substance use, and HIV among LGBT persons in Lesotho are understudied. We explore associations between LGBT stigma, mental health stressors, and HIV vulnerabilities among LGBT persons in Lesotho. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 46 LGBT persons and six key informants (e.g. healthcare providers). Participants described depression, substance use, and HIV as mutually reinforcing and situated in larger social contexts of stigma. Alcohol use was a stigma coping strategy and a way to build LGBT connections. At the same time, alcohol use elevated HIV vulnerabilities by lowering condom use uptake. Pervasive stigma reinforced barriers to healthcare engagement. Community-led support and services were leveraged to navigate stigma, reduce HIV vulnerabilities, and ultimately improve health. Findings emphasize the key role contexts play in shaping sexual and mental health among LGBT persons in Lesotho.

N2  - Syndemics, or comorbid and mutually reinforcing psychosocial problems, are associated with increased HIV risk among men who have sex with men (MSM). Although the dynamic interplay among syndemic indicators is theorized to be crucial for increasing risk of HIV acquisition, novel approaches are needed to understand how these syndemic problems interrelate. This study examined the associations between nine self-reported syndemic indicators in 194 MSM at high risk of HIV acquisition. We compared exploratory factor analyses (EFA) to a network analysis. In the present study, network analysis consisted of edges representing bidirectional partial polychoric correlations between nodes, which represent psychosocial syndemic indicators. EFA yielded a 1-factor solution including suicidal ideation (SI), injection drug use (IDU), depression, social anxiety, intimate partner violence, substance use, and sexual compulsivity, and excluded heavy drinking and childhood sexual abuse. Network analysis yielded a pattern of interconnectedness with the most central nodes being SI, IDU, substance use, and depression. Statistically significant relationships (absolute edge weights) were found between SI and depression, social anxiety, and IDU, and IDU and substance use. These results suggest that depression and substance use, especially more severe presentations of these conditions such as SI and IDU, are prominent interconnected components of the HIV syndemic among MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition. SI, IDU, substance use, and depression may indeed be prudent targets of intervention. Future research on the inclusion of these syndemic indicators in analytical models involving interaction terms may be warranted.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Syndemic theory has been useful in illuminating the co-existence and reinforcing nature of multiple health and social conditions that contribute to HIV risk. However, little research has examined syndemics among young Black gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) or situated syndemics within the context of racism, homonegativity, and other intersecting social inequities. Applying an intersectional framework to syndemics can help demonstrate how social and structural inequities and oppression facing young Black GBM contribute to and reinforce syndemic health conditions. In 2018, we conducted 45 in-depth qualitative interviews with young Black GBM in Milwaukee and Cleveland. Our analyses examined how intersectional stigma contributes to syndemics and HIV disparities facing young Black GBM. Our findings demonstrate that broader systems of oppression and disadvantage facing young Black GBM contribute to syndemic conditions. Future conceptualizations and measurements of syndemics must capture these experiences to strengthen our understanding of syndemics among young Black GBM. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Exchange sex is a behavior associated with HIV transmission risk among men who have sex with men (MSM). Few studies have examined exchange sex among HIV-positive MSM. We utilize a syndemic framework to account for co-occurring psychosocial problems that suggest the presence of intertwining epidemics (i.e., syndemics), which have not been examined within the context of exchange sex among HIV-positive MSM. In 2015, MSM were recruited via online sexual networking Web site and app advertisements for Sex Positive![+], a video-based online intervention that aimed to improve health outcomes for men living with HIV. Participants completed surveys every three months for a year. Surveys covered demographics, drug use, exchange sex, intimate partner violence (IPV), and past 2-week depressive symptoms. We conducted three logistic regression models to assess syndemic factors associated with exchange sex in the past 3 months. Of the 722 HIV-positive MSM included in the sample, 59 (8%) reported exchange sex in the past 3 months at 12-month follow-up. HIV-positive MSM who had more syndemic factors had greater odds of exchange sex. Exchange sex was associated with being African-American/Black, age 18-29 years, past and present experiences with IPV, stimulant use, polysubstance use, and depressive symptoms. Exchange sex was associated with multiple psychosocial factors, indicating exchange sex may be part of a syndemic involving substance use, depression, HIV, and IPV. Interventions should address the social and behavioral circumstances that perpetuate environments that can foster multiple negative health outcomes.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Adolescent males who have sex with males (AMSM) are at increased risk of HIV/STI acquisition compared to other adolescents, making sexual risk behaviors in this population a priority public health focus. AMSM experience more victimization (including sexual/partner violence), depression, and substance abuse than their heterosexual counterparts; these may form a syndemic associated with risky sexual behavior. We pooled data from the 2015 and 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, restricted to male students who reported a previous male sexual partner (n = 448). Latent profile analysis was used to identify syndemic profiles, with log-binomial and cumulative complementary log-log models used to test associations with substance use at last intercourse, condomless sex at last intercourse, and the number of sexual partners. Nearly all measures of victimization, depression, and substance use had bivariate associations with greater substance use during sex and more sexual partners. We identified three profiles of AMSM: The profile (n = 55) with the greatest risk factors (evident of a syndemic) had substantially higher prevalence of substance use during sex (aPR = 4.74, 95% CI 3.02, 7.43) and more sexual partners (aPR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.39, 4.31) than the profile with the lowest risk factors (n = 326) after adjusting for confounders. This profile was not associated with condomless sex. We identified a syndemic characterized by victimization, depression, and substance use associated with risky sexual behaviors in a nationally representative sample of AMSM. Comprehensive sexual risk reduction interventions incorporating mental health and substance use are critically important in this population.

N2  - Syphilis and HIV among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are syndemic suggesting current prevention strategies are not effective. Sex partner meeting places and their networks may yield effective and optimal interventions. From 2009 to 2017, 57 unique venues were reported by > 1 MSM and 7.0% (n = 4), 21.1% (n = 12) and 71.9% (n = 41) were classified as syphilis, HIV or co-diagnosed venues, respectively. Forty-nine venues were connected in one main network component with four online, co-diagnosis venues representing 51.6% of reports and the highest degree and eigenvector centralities. In a sub-analysis during a local syphilis epidemic, the proportion of venues connected in the main component increased 38.7% (61.5% to 86.4%); suggesting increasing overlap in syphilis and HIV transmission and density of the venue network structure over time. This network analysis may identify the optimal set of venues for tailored interventions. It also suggests increasing difficulty of interrupting network transmission through fragmentation.

N2  - In the U.S., sexual minority men (SMM) are disproportionately affected by HIV. Interventions are needed to increase HIV prevention and treatment behaviors, especially among syndemically exposed SMM. In recent years, researchers have created and tested combination behavioral interventions co-targeting syndemics and HIV-related health behaviors. We evaluated that literature via systematic review and meta-analysis, identifying 44 trials targeting mental health symptoms, alcohol use, and drug use, as well as sexual risk behavior, antiretroviral adherence, and healthcare engagement. For the randomized controlled trials, we computed between-group, pre-post effect sizes and tested them via random-effects models. Results supported the efficacy of combined interventions with significant, small, positive effects for improving mental health and reducing substance use (d = .20, CIs: 0.12, .29), and reducing sexual risk behavior and improving antiretroviral adherence (d = .16, CIs: .03, .30). Stratification analyses indicate that longer (9+ sessions) and individual (vs. group) interventions resulted in stronger effects on syndemic but not health behavior outcomes. Intervention developers should attend to intervention intensity and format. More evidence is needed about the importance of additional factors, such as novel intervention targets and cultural tailoring, as well as broadening the focus to multi-level interventions to address both interpersonal and structural mechanisms of change.

N2  - This study aimed to examine the effect of a syndemic theory-based intervention to reduce condomless anal intercourse among men who have sex with men (MSM) in India. In 2016/17, a pre- and post-test comparison group design was used to implement a syndemic theory-based intervention among 459 MSM (229, intervention; 230, standard-of-care comparison) recruited through non-governmental organizations in Chandigarh, India. The intervention group received two-session peer-delivered motivational interviewing-based HIV risk reduction counselling and skills training to improve sexual communication/negotiation and condom use self-efficacy, and screening/management of psychosocial health problems. The intervention's effect on consistent condom use was estimated using difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. Mediation analysis assessed the extent to which intervention effects on the outcome were mediated by changes in psychosocial health problems and condom use self-efficacy. A process evaluation assessed implementation fidelity and intervention acceptability. Baseline consistent condom use was 43% in the intervention group and 46% in the standard-of-care group. Baseline survey findings demonstrated that a psychosocial syndemic of problematic alcohol use, internalised homonegativity and violence victimisation synergistically increased condomless anal intercourse. Using DiD, we estimated that the intervention increased consistent condom use with male partners by 16.4% (95% CI: 7.1, 25.7) and with female partners by 28.2% (95% CI: 11.9, 44.4), and decreased problematic alcohol use by 24.3% (95%CI: -33.4, -15.3), depression by 20.0% (95% CI: -27.6, -12.3) and internalised homonegativity by 34.7% (95% CI: -43.6%, -25.8%). The mediation analysis findings suggested that the intervention might have improved consistent condom use by decreasing internalised homonegativity and by increasing condom use self-efficacy. The process evaluation showed high levels of acceptability/satisfaction among participants and high levels of implementation fidelity. A syndemic theory-based intervention tailored for MSM in India is feasible, acceptable, and can reduce HIV transmission risk behaviour as well as problematic alcohol use, depression and internalised homonegativity.

N2  - In this longitudinal qualitative study we explored the lived experiences of young Black men who have sex with men in Dallas, Texas in relation to methamphetamine use, intimate partner violence and a history of incarceration as syndemic conditions that may contribute to their risk of transmitting or acquiring HIV. We conducted a total of 106 interviews (four repeat interviews every six months) with a cohort of 30 participants. Some reported condomless sex and no discussion about condom use or HIV status with sexual partners. Fifteen participants reported that they were living with HIV. Methamphetamine use contributed to participants' unstable housing, job loss, destructive relationships and HIV risk. One third of participants reported a history of intimate partner violence. About half had a history of incarceration resulting from intimate partner violence, substance use/dealing and/or other activities. Post-release, having a criminal record limited job opportunities and impacted financial stability. Consequently, some men engaged in survival work involving HIV risk (sex work, organising/participating in sex parties). Methamphetamine use, intimate partner violence and incarceration may constitute syndemic conditions that increase young Black men who have sex with men's risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. HIV prevention interventions must address syndemics and include structural factors and the wider social environment.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Young men who have sex with men (MSM) experience multiple health disparities, including alcohol and drug use, partner violence, victimization due to sexual orientation, and HIV infection. Syndemic theorists explain the clustering of these disparities among adult MSM as a result of cultural marginalization. To date, research on a similar emerging syndemic among young MSM has been limited to quantitative studies. This study seeks to better understand these disparities, and how they may cluster together, via qualitative interviews with 21 ethnically diverse, HIV infected young MSM aged 18-24 years old. These youth report a lack of gay-specific HIV prevention education, absence of role models, and lack of productive future goal-related activities as factors related to their acquisition of HIV, and downplay substance use as a factor. Although not necessarily the components traditionally cited by syndemic theorists, these findings support the notion that multiple factors of cultural marginalization cluster together in the lives of young MSM, and underscore the importance of community-level interventions, such as sexual health education, access to mentors, and assistance with future goal setting and planning.

N2  - The theory of syndemics has been widely applied in HIV prevention studies of gay, bisexual, and other MSM over the last decade. Our investigation is the first to consider the applicability of the theory in a sample of aging (ages 50 and over) HIV-positive MSM, which is a growing population in the United States. A sample of 199 men were actively recruited and assessed in terms of mental health and drug use burden, as well as sexual risk behaviors. Bivariate and multivariable analyses indicate a high level of association between psychosocial burdens (i.e., drug use and mental health) and same-sex unprotected sexual behaviors, providing initial support for the applicability of the theory of syndemics to this population. Further support can be seen in participants' narratives. Findings suggest the mutually reinforcing nature of drug use, psychiatric disorders, and unprotected sexual behavior in older, HIV-positive, gay, bisexual, and other MSM, highlighting the need for holistic strategies to prevention and care among this population of older and sexually active individuals. In short, the generation of gay men who came of age in the late 1970s and 1980s, "the AIDS Generation," are continuing to mature such that further efforts must be enacted to meet the multidimensional nature of these men's physical, mental, and sexual health needs.

N2  - Young Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) are a highly vulnerable population for HIV infection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a novel biomedical HIV prevention tool that may aid in reducing the disparity in HIV incidence among Latino MSM. However, PrEP use is disproportionally low among Latino MSM and, therefore, identifying barriers along the PrEP continuum of care (the "PrEP cascade") would provide insight into how to best deploy PrEP interventions. Syndemics theory is a prominent framework employed in HIV prevention; however, to date, no known studies have applied this theory to PrEP. Thus, the aim of the current study was to explore the association between syndemics and the PrEP cascade, including the degree to which psychosocial and structural syndemic constructs are related to the PrEP cascade. Participants were 151 young Latino MSM (M age = 24 years; SD = 3) residing in San Diego, California, who completed a battery of online self-report measures. Results indicated high levels of syndemic indicators and varying levels of engagement across the PrEP cascade. As syndemic indicators increased, the odds of engagement across the PrEP cascade were significantly lowered. Psychosocial and structural syndemic factors accounted for unique variance in the PrEP cascade. Results highlight the need for combination interventions that address both psychosocial and structural barriers to PrEP use and persistence among young Latino MSM.

N2  - The interaction between the cumulative effect of psychosocial and structural factors (i.e. syndemic effect) and social networks among young Black transgender women and men who have sex with men (YBTM) remains understudied. A representative cohort of 16-29 year-old YBTM (n = 618) was assessed for syndemic factors [i.e. substance use; community violence; depression; poverty; justice system involvement (JSI)], social network characteristics, condomless anal sex (CAS), group sex (GS), and HIV-infection. The syndemic index significantly increased the odds of CAS, GS, and HIV-infection, and these effects were moderated by network characteristics. Network JSI buffered the effect on CAS, romantic network members buffered the effect on GS, and network age and proportion of family network members buffered the effect on HIV-infection. The proportion of friend network members augmented the effect on GS and HIV-infection. Future research to prevent HIV among YBTM should consider social network approaches that target both structural and psychosocial syndemic factors.

N2  - Among men who have sex with men (MSM), methamphetamine use is associated with multiple, overlapping syndemic conditions including increased risk for HIV seroconversion and onward HIV transmission. Contingency management (CM) is an evidence-based, behavioral intervention implemented to curb methamphetamine use and optimize HIV/AIDS prevention among MSM in San Francisco since 2003. We conducted a program evaluation to document the evolution of this 12-week CM program to include delivery of brief, individual counseling incorporating motivational interviewing and behavioral skills. A drop-in group delivered concurrently with CM urine-screening visits also provides peer support as well as referrals for other social and medical services. From December 2011-October 2013, a total of 131 clients enrolled in the CM program and provided a median of 22 urine samples (Interquartile Range = 10-34) that were non-reactive for methamphetamine. Findings support the feasibility and acceptability of integrating individual and group counseling with community-based CM for methamphetamine-using MSM.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although studies consistently find that syndemic indicators are additively associated with increased HIV/STI risk behavior (e.g., condomless anal sex; CAS) among men who have sex with men (MSM), information is lacking about how syndemic indicators are associated with each other. Young Latino MSM are one of the most at-risk groups for acquiring HIV in the U.S. Understanding the associations of syndemic indicators with each other and with CAS may improve understanding of how to enhance sexual and behavioral health in this population., METHOD: Network analysis using the graphical LASSO (glasso) algorithm was employed to explore associations between CAS and syndemic indicators among 139 young Latino MSM. Structural and psychosocial syndemic indicators were assessed via self-report. CAS was defined as the number of partners in the past 3 months with whom one engaged in CAS., RESULTS: Results of the network analysis suggested the variables with the highest centrality were unstable housing, prison history, childhood sexual abuse, and CAS. Specific significant associations included links between CAS and alcohol use (b = 0.40), childhood sexual abuse and unstable housing (b = - 0.75), alcohol use and childhood sexual abuse (b = 0.40), and substance use and intimate partner violence (b = 0.43)., CONCLUSION: This pattern of interconnectedness demonstrates the potential for network analysis to examine nuanced interrelationships of syndemic indicators. The specific associations in this sample raise the question whether a primary focus of interventions should address the more central syndemic indicators for this population, such as alcohol use and unstable housing, and whether this would, via downstream effects, affect other aspects of behavioral health in this population.

N2  - Transgender women and MSM experience many stigma-related syndemic conditions that exacerbate HIV incidence and prevalence rates. While PrEP is an effective biomedical intervention to reduce HIV transmission, uptake and adherence of PrEP is low among transgender women and MSM experiencing multiple syndemic health disparities. This study tested the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of A.S.K.-PrEP (AssistanceServicesKnowledge-PrEP), a five-session peer navigator program, designed to link transgender women and MSM to PrEP. From September 2016 to March 2018, 187 participants (transgender women = 58; MSM = 129) enrolled. Results demonstrated that approximately 90% of transgender women and MSM were linked to PrEP; MSM linked more quickly [KW chi2(1) = 10.9, p < .001]. Most transgender women (80%) and MSM (70%) reported they were still taking PrEP at the 90-day follow-up evaluation. Findings indicated that A.S.K.-PrEP is a promising intervention for PrEP linkage, uptake and preliminary adherence among transgender women and MSM.

N2  - Purpose: Psychosocial syndemic indicators (e.g., internalizing symptoms, alcohol/substance use, and violence exposure) have been associated with increased risk for HIV among older adolescent sexual minority males and adult sexual minority men. No studies have examined these concerns among early adolescents (<16 years old). The purpose of this study was to examine syndemic indicators among early adolescent sexual minority males and their associations with sexual behavior. Methods: Sexual minority males (N = 207; ages 14-17; drawn from 40 U.S. states) completed a cross-sectional online survey. Descriptive statistics were used to document profiles of syndemic indicators. Firth logistic regressions tested the associations between count of syndemic indicators and sexual behavior with male and female partners. Results: Psychosocial syndemic indicators were highly prevalent and co-occurring, with diverse psychosocial profiles. After controlling for age, race, and ethnicity, having more syndemic indicators was significantly positively associated with condomless anal sex with male partners (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.84) and vaginal and/or anal sex with females (AOR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.25-2.47). Conclusions: This study documents the psychosocial profiles of syndemic indicators with a sample of early adolescent sexual minority males and the association of syndemic indicators with sexual behavior. Among early adolescent sexual minority males, psychosocial concerns were prevalent, similar to rates seen among adult sexual minority males, and conferred vulnerability to HIV transmission. Behavioral and psychosocial interventions must reach sexual minority males in early adolescence to address mental health and substance use concerns and to help reduce the risk of HIV acquisition.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Purpose: The high prevalence of physical health conditions among sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals could be explained, in part, by SGM individuals' disparate exposure to interconnected psychosocial syndemic risks, including substance use, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, intimate partner violence, and sexual assault. We utilized a syndemic framework to understand the overlapping and potentially synergistic association between psychosocial syndemic risks and physical health conditions among SGM adults. Methods: A sample of 298 self-identified SGM adults (M age = 28.03, SD = 9.86; 47.0% racial/ethnic minority, 41.6% transgender or gender nonconforming) completed an online survey from May 2016 through May 2017. Results: Three (1.0%) participants reported no syndemic risks, 19 (6.4%) reported one, 52 (17.4%) reported two, 85 (28.5%) reported three, 89 (29.9%) reported four, and 50 (16.8%) reported all five syndemic risks. The number of psychosocial syndemic risks was positively associated with the number of physical health conditions and synergistically (i.e., more than additively) increased the overall health burden on SGM individuals. Conclusion:  We found evidence for psychosocial syndemic risks as predictors of SGM individuals' physical health. This study is novel in providing evidence for syndemics surrounding a comprehensive set of physical health outcomes among individuals identifying along a full spectrum of SGM identities. The study controlled for HIV to examine syndemic conditions surrounding physical health outcomes beyond this well-established syndemically determined condition. Comprehensive intervention and policy efforts that address co-occurring psychosocial risks for physical health conditions are needed to reduce health disparities affecting SGM populations.

N2  - Recovery housing is a promising way to augment the substance use continuum of care, but we know little about the experiences of members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community who live in them or about residences specifically for them. Within the LGBTQ community, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) often experience co-occurring syndemic conditions (e.g., trauma, depression, HIV) that present unique recovery challenges. Using qualitative data gathered from residents living in a recovery residence specifically for gay and bisexual men and from community key informants, we examine the experiences of men living in the home and factors that facilitate operating it. Findings highlight the need for residences that can address syndemic burden among gay and bisexual men in recovery and identify programmatic and community-level factors critical to operating residences for this population.

N2  - HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has shown great promise in reducing HIV transmission among affected populations; however, PrEP uptake among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) has stalled. This study compares BMSM using PrEP and BMSM at risk for HIV not using PrEP based on differences in behavior, psychosocial conditions and the presence of a syndemic (n = 1,411). BMSM reporting PrEP use were significantly more likely to report three of five HIV risk behaviors and three of four psychosocial conditions. Odds of reporting PrEP use increased as the number of psychosocial conditions increased such that BMSM with three psychosocial conditions (AOR = 5.65, 95% CI: 3.17, 10.08) and four conditions (AOR = 18.34, 95% CI: 5.01, 67.20) demonstrated significantly greater odds of PrEP use compared to BMSM reporting one or less conditions. While BMSM at greatest risk are using PrEP, strategies are still needed for men at varying risk levels.

N2  - Background or Objectives: Worldwide, men who have sex with men (MSM) and Transgender persons are vulnerable to psychosocial factors associated with high risk for HIV, and suffer disproportionately high rates of HIV/AIDS. In the United States (US), the House Ball Community (HBC) is a social network comprised predominantly of Black and Hispanic MSM and Transgender persons who reside in communal settings. This study explores Western New York HBC leaders' perceptions of HIV in their communities and their knowledge of HIV prevention strategies, including HIV vaccine trials., Methods: The project was conducted using an exploratory approach based on the principles of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methods. An HIV behavioral risk assessment provided descriptive data, while qualitative measures explored psychosocial and behavioral factors., Results: Behavioral assessments indicated high levels of risky sexual behaviors and experiences of violence. Interviews with 14 HBC leaders revealed that knowledge of HIV and local HIV vaccines trials was limited. Barriers to HIV knowledge included fear of peer judgment, having inaccurate information, and lack of formal education. Experiencing violence was identified as barrier to positive health behavior. Nevertheless, the HBC was described as a safe and creative space for marginalized MSM and Transgender youth., Conclusion and Global Health Implications: Findings suggest that the interrelation between health problems and social context amplify HIV risk in the HBC. The organizational structure and resources of the HBC, and MSM/Transgender communities worldwide can be instrumental in informing interventions to address HIV-related risk behaviors and create appropriate recruitment tools to ensure their representation in HIV research.

N2  - Globally, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) experience an increased burden of poor sexual, mental and physical health. Syndemics theory provides a framework to understand comorbidities and health among marginalised populations. Syndemics theory attempts to account for the social, environmental, and other structural contexts that are driving and/or sustaining simultaneous multiple negative health outcomes, but has been widely critiqued. In this paper, we conceptualise a new framework to counter syndemics by assessing the key theoretical mechanisms by which pathogenic social context variables relate to ill-health. Subsequently, we examine how salutogenic, assets-based approaches to health improvement could function among GBMSM across diverse national contexts. Comparative quantitative secondary analysis of data on syndemics and community assets are presented from two international, online, cross-sectional surveys of GBMSM (SMMASH2 in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and Sex Now in Canada). Negative sexual, mental and physical health outcomes were clustered as hypothesised, providing evidence of the syndemic. We found that syndemic ill-health was associated with social isolation and the experience of stigma and discrimination, but this varied across national contexts. Moreover, while some of our measures of community assets appeared to have a protective effect on syndemic ill-health, others did not. These results present an important step forward in our understanding of syndemic ill-health and provide new insights into how to intervene to reduce it. They point to a theoretical mechanism through which salutogenic approaches to health improvement could function and provide new strategies for working with communities to understand the proposed processes of change that are required. To move forward, we suggest conceptualising syndemics within a complex adaptive systems model, which enables consideration of the development, sustainment and resilience to syndemics both within individuals and at the population-level.

N2  - In the HIV pandemic, cisgender (ie, non-transgender) men with transgender partners are an underserved population. Complexities of sexuality and gender affect HIV vulnerability for this group, including not identifying with conventional sexual orientation categories (eg, bisexual, heterosexual, or gay) and having attractions based on gender role or expression rather than genital anatomy. Only one HIV prevention interventional study in this population was identified, and one study that assessed the perceived acceptability of an intervention. We found no data for interventions using pre-exposure prophylaxis, interventions for cisgender men with transgender men partners, or cisgender men with casual or transactional sexual partnerships with transgender people. Cisgender men with transgender partners are not easily categorised using traditional HIV risk categories. Additional research is needed to understand stigma and other structural drivers of HIV vulnerability, sexual networks and practices, substance use patterns, and biomedical prevention interest and uptake for this group. Studies that use an intersectional lens and syndemic framework could offer key insights. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background. While HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Vietnam has received increasing attention, most studies focus on HIV knowledge and established risk factors such as injection drug use. This paper proposes to address HIV risk among MSM from an integrated approach to preventive care that takes into account syndemic conditions such as substance use, mental health, and stigma, the latter of which prevents MSM from accessing health services. Method. Current studies related to MSM in Vietnam from 2000 onwards, gathered from peer-reviewed as well as non-peer-reviewed sources, were examined. Results . HIV and STI prevalence among MSM varied significantly by location, and yet HIV prevalence has increased significantly over the past few years. Most studies have focused on sexual risk behaviors, paying little attention to the broad spectrum of sexual health, including noninjecting drug use, heavy alcohol consumption, high rates of mental health distress and anxiety, and stigma. Conclusion . Future research and interventions targeting MSM in Vietnam should address their vulnerability to HIV from an integrated approach that pays attention to both sexual health and syndemic conditions.

N2  - Latinx men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. Identifying the role of multiple syndemic factors associated with sexual risk behaviors is imperative in order to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. Cross-sectional data for this study were derived from three cycles of the Philadelphia portion of the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System. This study explored the impact of syndemic factors - heavy drinking, exchange sex, and homophobic discrimination - on sexual HIV risk behaviors, operationalized as number of male partners, and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with main and casual partners among Latinx MSM (n=464). Analyses took two forms: a syndemic approach, using the cumulative number of conditions as an independent variable; and a non-syndemic approach, incorporating each condition as a unique factor. In multivariable syndemic analyses, participants with two or more factors reported more male partners and more CAI casual male partners than those with none. In non-syndemic models, homophobic discrimination and exchange sex were significantly positively associated with total number of male partners, while heavy drinking was associated with more casual CAI partners. Quantitative results indicate that syndemic and non-syndemic approaches vary in their relative capacity to account for sexual risk among Latinx MSM.

N2  - Using syndemics theory as a framework, we explored the experience of men who have sex with men in India in relation to four syndemic conditions (depression, alcohol use, internalised homonegativity and violence victimisation) and to understand their resilience resources. Five focus groups were conducted among a purposive sample of diverse men along with seven key informant interviews with HIV service providers. Participants ' narratives suggested various pathways by which syndemic conditions interact with one another to sequentially or concurrently increase HIV risk. Experiences of discrimination and violence from a range of perpetrators (family, ruffians and police) contributed to internalised homonegativity and/or depression, which in turn led some men to use alcohol as a coping strategy. Stigma related to same-sex sexuality, gender non-conformity and sex work contributed to the production of one or more syndemic conditions. While rejection by family and male regular partners contributed to depression/alcohol use, support from family, regular partners and peers served as resources of resilience. In India, HIV prevention and health promotion efforts among men who have sex with men could be strengthened by multi-level multi-component interventions to reduce intersectional/intersecting stigma, address syndemic conditions and foster resilience - especially by promoting family acceptance and peer support.

N2  - Nigerian gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) experience negative psychosocial health problems, which may increase their risk for HIV infection. Few studies have explored the syndemic effect of co-occurring psychosocial health problems on HIV sexual risk among Nigerian GBMSM. We investigated the co-occurrence of syndemic psychosocial health problems and their synergistic effect on HIV risk behaviors. We assessed depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol dependence, tobacco use, and hard-drug use. The outcome variables were the number of male sexual partners and consistent condom use. In a multivariable model, experiencing 4 or more psychosocial health problems - compared to experience none or one psychosocial health problem - was significantly associated with increasing number of male sexual partners. We found no statistically significant association between the number of syndemic psychosocial health problems and consistent condom use. Our study findings provides evidence of a synergistic relationship between negative psychosocial health factors and HIV sexual risk behavior. These findings underscore the importance of developing HIV prevention programming aimed at reducing HIV transmission risk that incorporate substance use and mental health treatments, in order to improve the overall health and quality of life for Nigerian GBMSM.

N2  - Syndemic factors tend to co-occur and increase the risks of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), multiple sexual partners (MSP) and HIV vulnerability among men who have sex with men (MSM). This study aimed to test the synergistic effects of syndemic factors on HIV risk and to further explore the moderators between syndemics and HIV risk among Chinese MSM. A cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit MSM in Guangzhou to collect data on syndemic factors (depression, intimate partner violence, childhood sexual abuse [CSA], alcohol, and rush popper use before anal sex). The relative excess risk due to interactions (RERIs) was calculated to test the synergy in adjusted regression models. A moderated analysis was conducted to test the buffer effects of potential resilience factors (education and income). Among the 976 included MSM, individuals experiencing more syndemic factors were more likely to have CAI (odds ratio [OR]= 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.44), MSP (OR= 1.33, 95% CI 1.16-1.52), and HIV infection (OR= 1.46, 95% CI 1.12-1.90). RERIs showed a synergy of depression and rush popper use prior to sex for MSP (1.17, 95% CI 0.03-2.03) and CSA and rush popper use prior to sex for HIV infection (1.72, 95% CI 0.05-3.43). However, no significant association was found for the interaction between the number of syndemic factors and education or income. Our findings support the synergy approach in syndemic studies and highlight the need for comprehensive and multifactorial intervention strategies on sexual health of MSM. Future studies are needed to identify potential resilience factors among Chinese MSM.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Past research investigating syndemic factors and HIV-related outcomes has overlooked the impact of structural conditions on behaviours linked with HIV transmission and disease progression. Given prevalent substance use among our sample, we explored whether four structural conditions indicative of social marginalisation and previously correlated with increased risk for HIV infection demonstrated syndemic (additive/synergistic) effects on: (i) HIV viral suppression; and (ii) self-reported involvement in sexual HIV transmission behaviours among a prospective cohort mostly comprising men of colour who have sex with men (MCSM; i.e. Latino/Hispanic and African American/black men) in Los Angeles County., DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected between August 2014 and March 2017. The structural conditions of interest were: current unemployment, recent (<=6 months) incarceration history, 'unstable' accommodation (past month) and remote (>6 months) contact with health-care providers. Generalised estimating equations assessed possible additive effects of experiencing multiple structural conditions, and possible synergistic effects on the HIV-related outcomes., RESULTS: Of 428 participants, nearly half (49%) were HIV-positive at baseline. Involvement in sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours varied over follow-up (22-30%). Reporting >=2 structural syndemic conditions was significantly associated with reporting sexual HIV transmission risk behaviours among HIV-negative participants, and detectable viral load among HIV-positive participants. Frequent methamphetamine use was consistently associated with the HIV-related outcomes across the final multivariate models., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: When developing initiatives to address HIV transmission among marginalised sub-populations including MCSM, we must holistically consider systemic and structural issues (e.g. unemployment and homelessness), especially in the context of prevalent substance use.

T1  - Gender-Based Violence Against Transgender People in the United States: A Call for Research and Programming.

N2  - Gender-based violence (GBV) is an umbrella term for any harm that is perpetrated against a person's will and that results from power inequalities based on gender roles. Most global estimates of GBV implicitly refer only to the experiences of cisgender, heterosexually identified women, which often comes at the exclusion of transgender and gender nonconforming (trans) populations. Those who perpetrate violence against trans populations often target gender nonconformity, gender expression or identity, and perceived sexual orientation and thus these forms of violence should be considered within broader discussions of GBV. Nascent epidemiologic research suggests a high burden of GBV among trans populations, with an estimated prevalence that ranges from 7% to 89% among trans populations and subpopulations. Further, 165 trans persons have been reported murdered in the United States between 2008 and 2016. GBV is associated with multiple poor health outcomes and has been broadly posited as a component of syndemics, a term used to describe an interaction of diseases with underlying social forces, concomitant with limited prevention and response programs. The interaction of social stigma, inadequate laws, and punitive policies as well as a lack of effective GBV programs limits access to and use of GBV prevention and response programs among trans populations. This commentary summarizes the current body of research on GBV among trans populations and highlights areas for future research, intervention, and policy.

N2  - Little is known about how interacting psychosocial problems may influence sexual behaviour among men having sex with men taking Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This study assessed (1) the prevalence of depression, recreational drug-use and sexual risk behaviour; (2) changes in these psychosocial conditions over time; and (3) the interaction of drug use and depression with sexual risk behaviour. We analysed data of the Belgian Be-PrEP-ared cohort study (N = 200). We assessed depression using the PHQ-9, recreational drug use and receptive condomless anal intercourse (rCAI) with anonymous partners. Frequencies of psychosocial problems were compared at baseline, 9 and 18 months follow-up (FU). Bivariate associations between depression and drug-use behaviour, and their interaction with rCAI with anonymous sexual partners using was examined using linear regression. Receptive CAI increased from 41% at baseline to 53% at M18 (p = 0.038). At baseline, we found an interaction effect of poly-drug use and depression, potentiating rCAI with anonymous partners. Participants reporting poly-drug use associated with depression were significant more likely to report this type of sexual risk behaviour than those who did not report this association (p = 0.030). The high level of intertwined psychosocial problems call for multi-level interventions for those PrEP users experiencing a syndemic burden.

N2  - In the United States, men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV. To identify research gaps and inform HIV prevention for MSM, we conducted a scoping review of systematic reviews using CDC's Prevention Research Synthesis database. Eligibility criteria comprised English-language systematic reviews focused on HIV prevention for MSM, published during 1988-2017, and included at least one U.S. primary study. We coded data type, subpopulations, topics, and key findings. To assess study quality, we used the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). Among 129 relevant systematic reviews, study quality was high or moderate for 63%. Most common topics were sexual behavior and disease vulnerability. The most frequently mentioned MSM subgroups were HIV-positive, Black or African American, and young. Research gaps include Hispanic/Latino MSM, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), treatment as prevention, social determinants of health, health disparities, syndemics, and protective factors for sexual health.

N2  - Background Black and minority ethnic (BME) men who have sex with men (MSM) face a major burden in relation to HIV infection. Using a cross-sectional correlational survey design, the present study explored the relationships between HIV knowledge and reported sexual health and sexual behaviour in this population., METHODS: A convenience sample of 538 BME MSM was recruited in London, Leicester and Leeds: 346 (64%) self-identified as South Asian, 88 (16%) self-identified as Latin American, 76 (14%) self-identified as Black, 13 (2%) self-identified as mixed, and 15 (3%) self-identified as other., RESULTS: HIV knowledge was low across the board, and South Asian MSM manifested the lowest scores. Respondents who perceived their HIV risk to be low possessed the least HIV knowledge. There were interethnic differences in the frequency of gay sauna visits, sex-seeking on mobile applications, drug use and attendance at sex parties. Respondents reported a high frequency of racism and discrimination, with Black MSM reporting highest frequency., CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to raise awareness of HIV in BME MSM, and a culturally competent approach to HIV awareness-raising in BME MSM is required. These findings shed light on the contexts in which HIV prevention efforts should be targeted to reach specific ethnic groups, as well as some of the potential syndemics that can increase HIV risk or undermine HIV outcomes in BME MSM patients.

N2  - CONTEXT: Sexually transmitted infections (STI) and mental health and substance use (MHSU) disorders all occur at elevated rates in sexual and gender minorities. These overlapping epidemics, or syndemics, are exacerbated by challenges these same populations face in accessing sexual/gender minority-affirming services. Many publicly funded STI clinics are a low barrier and provide sexual minority-competent care. These sites therefore may be uniquely situated to address clients' MHSU-related needs., OBJECTIVE: We characterize the need and desire for MHSU services among STI clinic clients., DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a waiting room survey at 6 STI clinics in Metro Vancouver, Canada., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We calculated the proportion of clients with self-reported unmet MHSU needs in the previous 12 months and, among these clients, barriers to accessing MHSU services and desire for MHSU services within the STI clinic. We also examined social disparities in barriers to accessing MHSU services., RESULTS: Among 1115 respondents-65% of whom were sexual minorities-39% reported a recent need for MHSU-related care, most frequently in relation to anxiety (29%), depression (26%), substance use (10%), or suicide ideation (7%). Seventy-two percent of this group had not yet talked to a provider about their concern. Common barriers included shame (26%) and inability to afford the service (24%). Eighty-three percent of clients with unmet MHSU needs indicated that they were comfortable discussing MHSU concerns with an STI clinic provider, and 94% expressed desire to receive MHSU assessments, referrals, or counseling in the STI clinic. Sexual and gender minorities and those attending a suburban clinic were more likely to report barriers to accessing MHSU services., CONCLUSIONS: More than a quarter of STI clinic clients report unmet MHSU health care needs; moreover, these clients report high levels of comfort with and desire to discuss MHSU concerns with STI clinic providers. Sexually transmitted infections clinics are thus opportune sites for syndemic service integration.

N2  - Syndemic production theory has been used to explore HIV transmission risk or infections but has not been used to investigate prevention behavior, or with large samples of non-Whites. This analysis is the first to explore the impact of syndemic factors on previous six-month HIV screening behavior among US Black MSM. Data from Promoting Our Worth, Equality and Resilience (POWER) were analyzed from 3294 participants using syndemic variable counts and measures of interaction/synergy. Syndemic variables included: past three-month poly-drug use, depression, last year intimate partner violence, HIV risk and problematic binge drinking. BMSM reporting two syndemic factors were more likely to report screening (AOR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.04-1.80; p = 0.028) with no significant associations for three or more conditions. Measures of joint effect revealed that there were synergies among depression, problematic binge drinking and poly-drug use but these psychosocial factors cannot entirely explain testing patterns and excess disease burden among BMSM.

N2  - Syndemic methodology has been employed in several studies of HIV-related outcomes affecting Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) and rarely in Black heterosexual men. In contrast to the most common method for assessing syndemics, the use of a syndemic component index, latent class analysis can identify unique combinations of risk factors that may form a syndemic. Analyzing a primarily heterosexual sample of 1,786 Black men from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we used a 4 latent class model based on depression diagnosis, poverty, and healthcare access to predict ever having been HIV tested. Class 1 was characterized by low proportions of all the risk factors. Class 2 had relatively high healthcare barriers, being the most likely to not have a personal doctor (.8175) and the most likely to have no routine checkup in the past year (.6327) but had relatively low depression diagnosis and poverty. Class 3 had relatively high poverty (.8853), but generally low barriers to healthcare access. Class 4 was characterized by high proportions of all the risk factors. Using log-binomial regression models, there was a significantly lower prevalence of ever having been HIV tested among class 3 (PR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.49, 0.98) and class 4 (PR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.28, 0.84) compared to class 1. When adjusting for education, age, and marital status, the associations were attenuated but still significant for class 3 (aPR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52, 0.96) and class 4 (aPR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.46, 0.78). Latent class analysis may better serve syndemic research aims in understanding HIV-related outcomes among high-risk populations. Future research using this method to evaluate HIV testing outcomes among BMSM is recommended.

N2  - Individuals of transgender experience (ITE) in the United States face an elevated risk of HIV infection. Several conditions have been attributed to the high HIV incidence and prevalence within this group, including experiences of discrimination, unemployment, incarceration, stigma, and elevated rates of sexual risk and substance use. In response to these needs, the Gay and Lesbian Latino AIDS Education Initiative and Prevention Point Philadelphia, two local community-based organizations in Philadelphia, developed the Transhealth Information Project (TIP). TIP is a peer-led six-session hybrid individual- and group-based intervention emphasizing leadership, social and structural interventions, and HIV risk reduction that incorporates other evidence-based practices for HIV prevention and care. Since 2003, TIP has served over 1,500 ITE and linked them to HIV prevention and care services. TIP has an established record of reaching ITE and linking them to HIV prevention services and HIV primary care. TIP's utilization speaks to the need for interventions to respond to the complex, interacting syndemic factors that cumulatively determine HIV vulnerability among ITE.

N2  - This study examined the longitudinal effects of co-occurring psychosocial concerns, or syndemics, on HIV-positive sexual minority men's likelihood of engaging in serodiscordant condomless anal sex (CAS), a health behavior with implications for personal and public health. Participants included 390 HIV-positive sexual minority men from two prior secondary prevention trials. Over the course of the 1-year data collection period (up to 5 observations per participant), participants completed self-report measures of CAS, as well as six syndemic factors: post-traumatic stress disorder, childhood sexual abuse, depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and polysubstance/stimulant use. We employed multilevel modeling to examine the longitudinal additive effect of syndemics on serodiscordant CAS (binary) over the 1-year period. The number of syndemic conditions was a significant predictor of CAS, with each additional syndemic associated with 1.41 greater odds of CAS (p = .0004; 95% CI [1.16, 1.70]). Both the between-person (p = .0121, 95% CI [1.07, 1.69]) and within-person (p = .01, 95% CI [1.11, 2.10]) effects of syndemics were significant predictors, showing that an increase in the number of syndemic conditions across person and time both increased odds of CAS. Interventions addressing HIV-positive sexual minority men's sexual health behaviors should address the potential impact of co-occurring psychosocial concerns that affect these behaviors. This will benefit this population's personal sexual health and reduce transmission of HIV and STIs among sexual minority men.

N2  - African American men are disproportionately affected by, not only HIV/AIDS, but also chronic non-communicable diseases. Despite the known benefits of physical activity for reducing chronic non-communicable diseases, scant research has identified factors that may influence physical activity in this population. A growing literature centers on the syndemic theory, the notion that multiple adverse conditions interact synergistically, contributing to excess morbidity. This secondary data analysis examined two primary questions: whether syndemic conditions prospectively predicted physical activity, and whether, consistent with the syndemic theory, syndemic conditions interacted to predict physical activity. Participants were 595 African American men who have sex with men (MSM), a population underrepresented in health research, enrolled in a health-promotion intervention trial from 2008-2011. We used generalized-estimating-equations models to test the associations of syndemic conditions and resilience factors measured pre-intervention to self-reported physical activity 6 and 12 months post-intervention. As hypothesized, reporting more syndemic conditions pre-intervention predicted reporting less physical activity 6 and 12 months post-intervention, adjusting for the intervention. However, contrary to the syndemic theory, we did not find evidence for the interaction effects of syndemic conditions in predicting physical activity. Receiving high school education and having greater social network diversity predicted more physical activity whereas older age predicted less physical activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the syndemic theory in relation to physical activity. Although reporting a greater number of syndemic conditions was related to reduced physical activity, there was no evidence for synergy among syndemic conditions.

N2  - Sexual orientation related health disparities are well documented. Sexual minority men appear to be at risk for mental health problems due to the stress they experience in establishing and maintaining a minority sexual identity. These mental health issues may combine synergistically and lead to higher medical costs to society. We examine whether sexual minority specific syndemic indicators were associated with higher health care costs, health care utilization, or the risk of being HIV-infected. Health care consumers at a community health center (N = 1211) completed a brief screening questionnaire collected over 12 months. Self-reported data were linked with participants' clinical billing records. Adjusted logistic regression models identified that four syndemic indicators (suicidality, substance use, childhood sexual abuse, and intimate partner violence) were each significantly related to each other. Multiple syndemics significantly predicted higher medical care utilization and cost, and were associated with 2.5 times the risk of being HIV-infected (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.45-4.25). Syndemic indicators did not significantly predict the number of mental health visits or costs per patient. These results confirm and extend earlier findings by relating syndemics to health services use and costs for sexual minority men.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Sexual minority men (SMM) in the United States continue to experience adverse health problems and psychosocial burdens. However, there is limited psychometric research seeking to quantify the life worries of this population. Informed by syndemic theory, the Life Worries Scale (LWS) was developed to measure the concerns of young SMM., METHOD: Analyses of the scale were undertaken using baseline data (n = 665) from an ongoing cohort study of emerging adult, SMM., RESULTS: Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) of an initial set of 24 Likert-type items, followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and an exploratory structural equation model (ESEM), indicated a structure consisting of 6 domains of worries: financial stability, social stability, self esteem, loneliness, physical appearance, and physical health. These 6 subscales were highly correlated and also demonstrated high levels of internal consistency. Differences in life worries were noted across demographic states, specifically HIV serostatus, sexual attraction, housing status, and self-rated health. High levels of association were also detected between all 6 subscales with both depression and PTSD, while significant correlations were detected between suicidality and both self esteem and loneliness related worries., CONCLUSIONS: The results of our analyses provide evidence for the strong psychometric characteristics of the LWS. This newly developed instrument should be utilized in research to examine the extent to which life worries explain health outcomes and risk behaviors in sexual minority males, and may be potentially extended for use in other populations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While several studies have demonstrated that gay and bisexual men are at increased risk of suicide less attention has been given to the processes that generate the inherent inequity with the mainstream population. This study tested whether syndemic theory can explain the excess suicide burden in a sample of Canadian gay and bisexual men. Syndemic theory accounts for co-occurring and mutually reinforcing epidemics suffered by vulnerable groups due to the effects of social marginalization., METHODS: This study used data from Sex Now 2011, a cross-sectional survey of Canadian gay and bisexual men (n = 8382). The analysis measured the extent to which anti-gay marginalization and several psychosocial health problems are associated with suicide related ideation and attempts. Since psychosocial health problems were hypothesized to have an additive effect on suicide related ideation and attempts, the analysis calculated the effect of accumulated psychosocial health problems on suicide behavior., RESULTS: Suicide ideation and attempts were positively associated with each individual marginalization indicator (verbal violence, physical violence, bullying, sexual violence and work discrimination) and psychosocial health problems (smoking, party drugs, depression, anxiety, STIs, HIV risk and HIV). Furthermore, prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts increased with each added psychosocial health problem. Those who reported 3 or more had 6.90 (5.47-8.70) times the odds of experiencing suicide ideation and 16.29 (9.82-27.02) times the odds of a suicide attempt compared to those with no psychosocial health problems., CONCLUSIONS: This investigation suggests that syndemics is a useful theory for studying suicide behavior among gay and bisexual men. Moreover, the findings highlight a need to address gay and bisexual men's health problems holistically and the urgent need to reduce this population's experience with marginalization and violence.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to understand how young bisexual women in Toronto perceive their sexual and reproductive health needs, the challenges to achieving those needs, and the factors contributing both positively and negatively to their sexual and reproductive health., METHODS: We conducted a community-based research project that included an advisory committee of young bisexual women, academic partners, and a community health centre. Four 2-hour focus group sessions were conducted with a total of 35 participants. Data were analyzed through a constructivist grounded theory approach using Nvivo software., RESULTS: Participants' discussion of their sexual and reproductive health indicated that they perceived social marginalization, particularly biphobia and monosexism, as a significant challenge to their health. Participants also discussed their sexual, reproductive and mental health as interconnected., CONCLUSIONS: Young bisexual women in this study perceived their sexual, reproductive and mental health as interconnected and negatively influenced by social marginalization. This perception is in line with syndemic research that illustrates the interrelationship between psychosocial and sexual health. Researchers should further explore the utility of syndemic theory in understanding the complexity of young bisexual women's health.

N2  - In contrast to intervention studies that assess psychosocial factors only as mediators or moderators of HIV risk, the present study assessed the effects of an Mpowerment-based community-level intervention on psychosocial determinants (e.g., depressive symptoms, sexual stigma) of HIV risk behavior among young black MSM. Approximately 330 respondents were surveyed annually for 4 years in each of two sites. General linear models examined change across time between the intervention and comparison communities, and participation effects in the intervention site. Social diffusion (spreading information within networks) of safer sex messages (p < 0.01) and comfort with being gay (p < 0.05) increased with time in intervention versus control. Cross-sectionally, intervention participants responded more favorably (p < 0.05) on social diffusion and depressive symptoms, but less favorably (p < 0.01) on sex in difficult situations and attitudes toward condom use. Findings suggest a need to address broader health issues of MSM as well as sexual risk.

N2  - To address childhood sexual abuse (CSA) related distress and HIV risk in men who have sex with men (MSM) using cognitive-behavioral therapy for trauma and self-care (CBT-TSC), which is a novel intervention integrating HIV risk reduction with modified cognitive and behavioral therapy strategies for post-traumatic stress. We compared CBT-TSC to HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)-only in an initial 2-arm RCT in 43 HIV-negative MSM at with a history of CSA and HIV risk. Serodiscordant condomless anal/vaginal sex (CAS; CAS with HIV-postive or HIV unknown status partners) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (Davidson Trauma Scale: total score and avoidance, intrusions, hyperarousal subscales) were outcomes immediately post-treatment, and at 6- and 9-month follow-up. At post-treatment, CBT-TSC had decreased odds (approximately 60%) of any CAS and greater reductions in CAS compared to VCT-only. Additionally, the CBT-TSC condition experienced greater reductions in total PTSD and avoidance symptoms. At the follow-up visits, CBT-TSC condition had significant reductions in the odds of any CAS and reductions in CAS. However, for PTSD symptoms, only the avoidance subscale remained significantly different compared to VCT-only. CBT-TSC is a potentially efficacious approach to address HIV risk in MSM with a CSA history, with replication and extension in a larger trial needed. This proof-of-concept trial is the first to integrate the treatment of a commonly occurring mental-health syndemic problem in MSM with a health psychology approach to self-care in MSM.Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01266122.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Syndemic theory posits that co-occurring problems (e.g., substance use, depression, and trauma) synergistically increase HIV risk in men who have sex with men (MSM). However, most investigations have assessed these problems additively using self-report., METHOD: In a sample of HIV-negative MSM with trauma histories (n = 290), we test bivariate relationships between four clinical diagnoses (substance use disorder [SUD]); major depressive disorder [MDD], posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], and anxiety disorders) and their additive and interactive effects on three health indicators (i.e., high-risk sex, visiting the emergency room [ER], and sexually transmitted infections [STIs])., RESULTS: We found significant bivariate relationships between SUD and MDD (chi2 = 4.85, p = .028) and between PTSD and MDD (chi2 = 35.38, p = .028, p < .001) but did not find a significant relationship between SUD and PTSD (chi2 = 3.64, p = .056). Number of diagnoses were associated with episodes of high-risk sex (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.14, 95% CI [1.03, 1.26], p = .009) and visiting the ER (odds ratio = 1.27; 95% CI [1.01, 1.60], p = .040) but not with STIs. No interactions were found between diagnoses and health-related indicators., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate additive effects of clinical diagnoses on risk behavior and health care utilization among MSM with developmental trauma histories. Results indicate the need to prioritize empirically supported treatments for SUD and MDD, in addition to trauma treatment, for this population.

N2  - Syndemics approaches explore the convergence of psychosocial factors that elevate HIV vulnerabilities. Less research has explored syndemics among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons in contexts where criminalization has downstream impacts on LGBT discrimination, such as Jamaica. We implemented a cross-sectional survey with LGBT persons (n = 911) in Jamaica. We conducted structural equation modeling to examine direct and indirect effects of a latent syndemics construct (binge drinking, depressive symptoms, childhood/adult abuse) on HIV vulnerabilities (lifetime sex partners, perceived HIV risk, condom self-efficacy) and the mediating role of protective factors (social support, resilient coping). Direct paths from syndemics to lifetime sex partners, perceived HIV risk, and condom self-efficacy were significant. Resilient coping and social support partially mediated the association between syndemics and condom use self-efficacy. Resilient coping partially mediated the relationship between syndemics and lifetime sex partners. Interventions can target syndemic issues to reduce HIV vulnerabilities among Jamaican LGBT persons.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In an era when HIV transmission has been on the rise among men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender women may play a considerable role in China's current HIV epidemic as a potential "bridge" of HIV transmission between homosexual and heterosexual populations. We sought to understand the risk behaviours and factors associated with HIV infection among transgender women in two cities in China., METHODS: From January to December 2016, we recruited transgender women with the help of community-based organizations (CBOs) through a wide range of methods, including snowball sampling. After recruitment, we asked participants to fill out a structured questionnaire including questions about socio-demographics, sexual behaviours, condom use, substance use and uptake of health care services. HIV infection status was determined by using two different rapid testing reagents., RESULTS: Among 498 subjects enrolled in this study, 233 were from Shanghai and 265 were from Tianjin. The median age was 30 years (range: 18-68; IQR: 24-33). Of them, 337 (67.7%) preferred feminine dress, 13 (2.6%) had undergone transsexual operation and 68 (13.7%) had used hormones for transition purposes. Nearly half (45.6%) reported having regular partners, and 351 (70.5%) had casual partners. Regarding condom use, 81.5% reported not always using condoms with stable partners, and 70.9% reported not using condoms with casual partners. Twenty-five (5.0%) had a history of buying sex and fifty-one (10.2%) had a history of selling sex in the past three months. A total of 200 (40.2%) participants had used at least one kind of controlled substance in the past six months. The most commonly used substances were amyl nitrates (rush popper) (99.5%) and 5-MeO-DiPT (20.0%). Among rush popper users, 170 (85.4%) reported always having sex while on the drug, and 177 (88.9%) reported increased sexual pleasure after using the drug. The HIV infection risk factors identified in our study were being located in Shanghai (aOR = 9.35, 95% CI = 3.89-22.49), selling sex in the past three months (aOR = 3.44, 95% CI = 1.31-9.01), and substance use in the past six months (aOR = 5.71, 95% CI = 2.63-12.41)., CONCLUSIONS: Transgender women bear a high HIV burden in the two Chinese cities. Those involved in commercial sex tended to have inconsistent condom use, leading to high risk of HIV infection. Substance use was an independent risk factor of HIV infection by increasing sexual activities and unprotected sex, which indicated an aggravated and complex situation with possible interacting syndemic factors that could cumulatively facilitate sexual risk behaviours and HIV infection in transgender women. There is an urgent need for innovative and appropriate HIV prevention programmes targeting this unique population. Efforts should be made to provide them with tailored services including persuasive communication on consistent condom use, substance use counselling and related referral services, all with the goal of reducing HIV epidemic among transgender women.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sexualised substance use, or 'chemsex' has been shown to be a major factor driving the syndemic of HIV/AIDS in communities of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) around the world. However, there is a paucity of research on chemsex among GBMSM in Singapore due to punitive drug laws and the criminalisation of sexual behaviour between men. This qualitative descriptive study is the first to explore perceptions towards, motivators to engaging in, and the barriers to addressing the harms associated with chemsex among GBMSM in Singapore., METHODS: We conducted 30 semi-structured in-depth interviews with self-identifying GBMSM between the ages of 18-39 in Singapore following a purposive sampling strategy. Interview topics included participants' perceptions of drug use among GBMSM in Singapore, perceptions towards chemsex, reasons for drug use and chemsex, and recommendations to address the harms associated with chemsex in Singapore. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and analysed using thematic analysis., RESULTS: Participants reported that it was common to encounter chemsex among GBMSM in Singapore as it could be easily accessed or initiated using social networking phone apps. Enhancement and prolongation of sexual experiences, fear of rejection from sexual partners and peers, and its use as a means of coping with societal rejection were three main reasons cited for engaging in chemsex. The impact of punitive drug laws on disclosure and stigmatisation of GBMSM who use drugs were reported to be key barriers towards addressing chemsex. Participants suggested using gay-specific commercial venues as avenues for awareness and educational campaigns, and social media to reach out to younger GBMSM., CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the complexities behind chemsex use among GBMSM in Singapore, and the range of individual to institutional factors to be addressed. We recommend that community-based organisations and policy-makers find ways to destigmatise discussion of chemsex and provide safe spaces to seek help for drug use. Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

T1  - Childhood sexual abuse among Black men who have sex with men: A cornerstone of a syndemic?.
A1  - Wu, Elwin
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The sequelae of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) includes HIV infection, engagement in HIV risk behaviors, substance misuse, and intimate partner violence (IPV). Although Black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately infected with HIV in the U.S.-especially in urban locations such as New York City-there is limited research with larger samples of Black MSM of varied HIV status regarding the prevalence of CSA and the potential negative consequence with respect to a "syndemic," i.e., the co-occurrence of adverse conditions such as HIVrisk, substance misuse, and IPV., METHODS: Black MSM (N = 1,002) recruited in New York City from 2009-2015 completed a screening assessment eliciting self-reported data on age, CSA, self-reported HIV status, number of male sexual partners, number of acts of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), substance misuse, and IPV. Hypothesis testing utilized logistic and linear regression models with self-reported data on CSA (independent variable) and indicators of the following syndemic factors: HIV risk, substance misuse, and IPV., RESULTS: More than one-fourth (28.1%) met criteria for experiencing CSA. CSA was associated with significantly greater odds of being HIV-positive (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.0); number of male sexual partners (b = 2.0, SE = 0.5, p = .002) and condomless acts of anal intercourse (b = 4.3, SE = 1.6, p = .007); odds of binge drinking (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.0) and illicit substance use (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.0); and odds of experiencing current IPV (AOR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2-2.3). CSA was associated with significantly greater odds of concurrently experiencing 2 or more syndemic factors (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.4-2.9, p < .001); concurrently experiencing 2 or more syndemic factors was significantly associated with having a riskier HIV status (for being HIV-positive: AOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.1, p = .02; for having an unknown HIV status: AOR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.9-12.9, p = .04)., CONCLUSIONS: Among Black MSM, CSA is a prevalent problem and is a significant antecedent to HIV, substance misuse, and IPV indicators and risk. Addressing CSA may be a valuable approach to remedy the syndemic of HIV, substance misuse, and violence that has burdened MSM, especially Black MSM, in the U.S.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in India are a key group at risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. They are also an extremely marginalized and stigmatized population, facing immense psychosocial stressors including, but not limited to, stigma, homophobia, discrimination, criminalization, low self-esteem, low self-acceptance, distress, and, as a result, high rates of mental health problems. Although these multi-level psychosocial problems may put MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition and transmission, currently HIV prevention interventions in India do not address them. This paper describes the design of a psychosocial intervention to reduce HIV risk for MSM in India., METHODS: Funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, this study is a two-arm randomized clinical efficacy trial of a self-acceptance based psychosocial HIV prevention intervention, informed by the minority stress model and syndemic theory, that was developed with extensive community-based formative work and input from the Indian MSM community and key informants who are knowledgeable about the experiences faced by MSM in India. Participants are MSM in Chennai and Mumbai who endorsed recent sexual behaviors placing them at high risk for HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition and transmission. Enrolled participants are equally randomized to either 1) the experimental condition, which consists of four group and six individual counseling sessions and includes standard of care HIV/STI testing and counseling, or 2) the standard of care condition, which includes HIV/STI testing and counseling alone. The primary outcomes are changes in the frequency of condomless anal sex acts and STI incidence (syphilis seropositivity and urethral, rectal, and pharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia infection. Major study assessment visits occur at baseline, 4-, 8-, and 12-months., DISCUSSION: HIV prevention interventions that address the psychosocial stressors faced by MSM in India are needed; this study will examine the efficacy of such an intervention. If the intervention is successful, it may be able to reduce the national HIV/AIDS burden in India while empowering a marginalized and highly stigmatized group., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02556294 , registered 22 September 2015.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - In order to address common statistical and population-based limitations in epidemiological literature applying syndemic theory, this study uses latent class analysis (LCA) to explore how health and social problems coalesce and shape sexual risk behaviors linked to HIV transmission in three Mexico City prisons. Among the studied male inmates, LCA identified four classes, defined by low syndemic risk (61.4%); marijuana (14.3%); depression, substances, and trauma (19.7%); and depression, substances, and marijuana (4.7%). In multinomial regression models, classes with a greater number of syndemic exposures were associated with increased odds of condomless anal sex during incarceration. In analyses stratified by pre-incarceration sexual risk behaviors, however, high syndemic burden classes were associated with condomless anal sex during incarceration differently. Overall, the study findings suggest that LCA has potential utility for syndemic analyses and highlight the need to attend to health and social adversities when addressing sexual risk behaviors and HIV transmission during incarceration.

T1  - Validating the Syndemic Threat Surrounding Sexual Minority Men's Health in a Population-Based Study With National Registry Linkage and a Heterosexual Comparison.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Research on the syndemic health threats facing sexual minority men suggests that the elevated risk of HIV among this population co-occurs with other psychosocial health disparities. This study aimed to conduct a population-based examination of clinically assessed syndemic predictors of HIV infection among gay and bisexual, compared with heterosexual, men., SETTING AND METHODS: The sample comprised adult men in the Stockholm Public Health Cohort. A total of 29,328 (91.9%) self-identified as heterosexual, 535 (1.7%) as gay, and 396 (1.2%) as bisexual. We linked survey responses to national health registry data., RESULTS: Gay men had vastly elevated risk of HIV infection (>150 times) compared with heterosexuals. Gay men also had an elevated risk of depression, suicidality, and violent assaults compared with heterosexuals. Bisexual men had 16 times higher risk of being HIV-positive than heterosexual men. The number of psychosocial syndemic conditions was significantly associated with HIV infection among gay men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.18 to 2.36), but not among bisexual and heterosexual men (AOR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.07 to 3.59; AOR = 1.92; 95% CI: 0.96 to 3.84). Among gay men, the association between co-occurring syndemic conditions and odds of HIV infection was synergistic (ie, more than additive)., CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms emerging evidence of the syndemic health threats affecting sexual minority men, finds stronger evidence for syndemics among gay compared with bisexual men, and suggests the need for HIV-prevention interventions that comprehensively address the co-occurring, and synergistically perpetuating, disparities affecting this population.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Among men who have sex with men (MSM), HIV sexual risk and poor self-care behavior is associated with syndemics, or co-occurring psychosocial problems. Though prior research has demonstrated an additive total effect of syndemics on HIV risk behavior and infection, mostly within cross-sectional designs, it is possible that these associations are not direct but rather that syndemics disrupt relevant individual-level mediating psychological variables. One of the more common individual-level psychological variables that predicts health behavior generally, and HIV risk behavior specifically, is self-efficacy. This study sought to examine the potential effects of syndemics on condomless sex via condom-use self-efficacy as an intermediary variable., METHOD: In high-risk MSM (N = 197), across 3 time points (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months) we used latent growth curve modeling to test the degree to which self-efficacy mediated the relationship between syndemics (heavy alcohol use, substance use disorder, sexual compulsivity, depression, social anxiety, intimate partner violence, childhood sexual abuse) and condomless anal sex., RESULTS: The baseline analyses were consistent with an indirect effect of the association between syndemics and condomless sex through self-efficacy. Prospective longitudinal mediation was partially supported, such that baseline syndemics were associated with lower baseline self-efficacy, which in turn predicted higher increases in condomless anal sex across time., CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence (due to the partial support for the longitudinal model) that syndemics themselves may not be directly causal in their association with condomless sex, but the association may be through modifiable social-cognitive mechanisms such as condom self-efficacy.

Participants completed measures of ART adherence (reduced to a non-adherence score using exploratory factor analysis) and six syndemic conditions. We employed multilevel modeling with the number of syndemics as a longitudinal predictor of non-adherence, and logistic regression with baseline syndemics predicting follow up viral load. Number of syndemics was a significant longitudinal predictor of non-adherence, with each additional syndemic associated with a 0.13 increase in non-adherence (p = 0.004). Each additional syndemic was also associated with 1.27 greater odds of detectable viral load (p = 0.002). Among HIV-positive sexual minority men in this sample, more syndemics were associated with lower ART adherence and greater odds of detectable viral load, suggesting the need for behavioral intervention to facilitate care for this population.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The standard clinical approach to non-occupational HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) focuses on biomedical aspects of the intervention, but may overlook co-occurring or 'syndemic' psychosocial problems that reinforce future vulnerability to HIV. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence of syndemic health problems in a cohort of Ontario nPEP patients, and explored the relationship between syndemic burden and HIV risk., METHODS: Between 07/2013-08/2016, we distributed a self-administered questionnaire to patients presenting to three clinics in Toronto and Ottawa seeking nPEP for sexual HIV exposures. We used validated screening tools to estimate the prevalence of depression (CES-D score >=16), harmful alcohol use (AUDIT >=8), problematic drug use (DUDIT >=6 men/>=2 women), and sexual compulsivity (SCS >=24) among men who have sex with men (MSM) respondents. In exploratory analyses, we examined the relationships between syndemic conditions using univariable logistic regression models, and the relationship between syndemic count (total number of syndemic conditions per participant) and HIV risk, as estimated by the HIRI-MSM score, using linear regression models., RESULTS: The 186 MSM included in the analysis had median age 31 (IQR = 26-36), including 87.6% having a college/undergraduate degree or higher. Overall, 53.8% screened positive for depression, 34.4% for harmful alcohol use, 30.1% for problematic drug use, and 16.1% for sexual compulsivity. Most participants (74.2%) had at least one syndemic condition and 46.8% had more than one. Exploratory analyses suggested positive associations between depression and harmful alcohol use (OR = 2.11, 95%CI = 1.13, 3.94) and between harmful alcohol use and problematic drug use (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 0.65, 2.29). Syndemic count was associated with increased HIRI-MSM risk scores in univariable (2.2, 95%CI = 1.0, 3.3 per syndemic condition) and multivariable (2.1, 95%CI = 0.6, 3.6) linear regression models., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of syndemic conditions in MSM seeking nPEP for sexual exposure is alarmingly high, and is associated with underlying HIV risk. Routine screening for these conditions may identify opportunities for intervention and could alleviate future vulnerability to HIV.

N2  - A commentary is provided on the study reported by Garrett Prestage and his colleagues, which examined the relations between mental health states, non-injection drug use and sexual risk behaviors in a cross-sectional sample of 3,017Australian gay and bisexual men. We provide a summary of the findings in relation to the extant literature on the interconnectedness of these behaviors and health states and interpret the findings in this regard, noting both strengths and limitations. We couch our commentary in a theory of syndemics for considering how these associations may manifest and for informing both research and practice. While the data from this investigation posit risk they also point to strength and suggest the application of a resilience framework for addressing the health needs of gay and bisexual men.

T1  - Syndemics: A theory in search of data or data in search of a theory?.
A1  - Tsai, Alexander C
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - The concept of a syndemic was proposed more than two decades ago to explain how large-scale social forces might give rise to co-occurring epidemics that synergistically interact to undermine health in vulnerable populations. This conceptual instrument has the potential to help policymakers and program implementers in their endeavors to improve population health. Accordingly, it has become an increasingly popular heuristic for advocacy, most notably in the field of HIV treatment and prevention. However, most empirical studies purporting to validate the theory of syndemics actually do no such thing. Tomori et al. (2018) provide a novel case study from India illustrating how the dominant empirical approach fails to promote deeper understanding about how hazardous alcohol use, illicit drug use, depression, childhood sexual abuse, and intimate partner violence interact to worsen HIV risk among men who have sex with men. In this commentary, I relate the theory of syndemics to other established social science and public health theories of disease distribution, identify possible sources of conceptual and empirical confusion, and provide concrete suggestions for how to validate the theory using a mixed-methods approach. The hope is that more evidence can be mobilized -- whether informed by the theory of syndemics or not -- to improve health and psychosocial wellbeing among vulnerable populations worldwide.

N2  - Syndemic theory describes the clustering and synergistic interaction of disease driven by contextual and social factors, which worsen health outcomes for a population, and has been applied to men who have sex with men (MSM) and their risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Recent reviews, however, have critiqued prevailing approaches in syndemic studies that assess only additive associations without evaluation of synergy. Following these suggestions, we compared the traditional additive approach with a test for synergistic association of 5 syndemic conditions (alcohol dependence, illicit drug use, depression, intimate partner violence (IPV), and childhood sexual abuse (CSA)) with unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) and active syphilis infection among 11,771 MSM recruited through respondent driven sampling from 12 cities in India. UAI was assessed via self-report and active syphilis infection was diagnosed by RPR and THPA tests. An additive association was explored using a condition count (range 0-5), and synergy was tested using relative excess risk due to interactions (RERIs) calculated from all 2-way and common 3-way interactions between conditions in adjusted regression models. There was a significant dose response associated with the syndemic count and UAI, and a similar pattern for syphilis, though not statistically significant. RERIs showed synergy for only one pair of conditions for UAI and syphilis, respectively: IPV + depression and alcohol dependence + illicit drug use. In this study, we found an additive association between syndemic conditions and UAI with evidence of synergistic interaction between a pair of psychosocial conditions, and no significant additive association, but a synergistic interaction between another pair of psychosocial conditions for syphilis. Our results lend further support to a critical reassessment of syndemic analyses. Closer attention to the cumulative development, underlying causal pathways, and possible synergistic interaction of co-occurring epidemics through combined qualitative and quantitative methodologies may yield more effective interventions for vulnerable, marginalized populations.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), collinearity between polysubstance use and mental health concerns has obscured their combined effects on HIV risk with multivariable results often highlighting only one or the other., METHODS: We used mediation and moderation analyses to examine the effects of polysubstance use and depressive symptoms on high-risk sex (i.e., condomless anal sex with serodiscordant/unknown status partner) in a sample of sexually-active GBM, aged >=16years, recruited in Metro Vancouver using respondent driven sampling. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores assessed mental health. Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test scores assessed alcohol disorders. Poly-use of multiple drug types (e.g., stimulants, sedatives, opiates, hallucinogens) was assessed over the previous six months., RESULTS: Among 719 predominantly white (68.0%), gay-identified (80.7%) GBM, alcohol use was not associated with increased prevalence of high-risk sex. Controlling for demographic factors and partner number, an interaction between polysubstance use and depressive symptoms revealed that the combined effects were additively associated with increased odds for high-risk sex. Mediation models showed that polysubstance use partially mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and high-risk sex., CONCLUSION: An interaction effect between polysubstance use (defined by using 3 or more substances in the past six months) and depressive symptoms (defined by HADS scores) revealed that the combination of these factors was associated with increased risk for high-risk sex - supporting a syndemic understanding of the production of HIV risk.

N2  - Scant research has addressed health and well-being among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) persons in the Arctic. The Northwest Territories (NWT) has among Canada's highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). LGBTQ persons in NWT are at the nexus of LGBTQ and Arctic health disparities. Yet little is known of their sexual health needs. This qualitative study explored the sexual health needs of LGBTQ persons in the NWT. We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 51 participants, including 16 LGBTQ youth aged 15-24, 21 LGBTQ adults aged 25 and above, and 14 key informants who worked with LGBTQ persons. Social-ecological approaches to understanding sexual health guided this study. Participants discussed how structural contexts such as heteronormativity in sexual health education and a lack of access to safer sex tools constrained their ability to practice safer sex. Social contexts of intersectional stigma resulted in shame, concealing identities, and fear of accessing safer sex materials. Myriad factors influenced partner communication about safer sex practices, including honesty, consent, and relationship power. Findings suggest the need for comprehensive sexuality education and interventions that address syndemics of substance use, stigma, and low self-esteem to advance sexual health among LGBTQ persons in Northern Canada.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - We trialed a nurse-led HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) program in two sexually transmitted infection clinics in Ottawa, Canada. From September 5, 2013 to September 4, 2015, 112 persons sought PEP: 103 were male, of whom 84 were men who have sex with men (MSM). Seventy-two patients (59 MSM) initiated PEP; 11 were diagnosed with HIV: 6 diagnoses occurred during initial assessment (all MSM; 1 also shared injection equipment); 5 MSM were diagnosed with HIV within 1 year of seeking PEP. This level of positivity indicated that, when access is facilitated, individuals at high risk of HIV seek PEP. However, the 8.5% of MSM who seroconverted within a year of taking PEP demonstrated that this group remained at risk and needed additional prevention services. Delivery of PEP should include provision of medication, as well as an opportunity to address individual-level HIV risk strategies and population-level syndemic conditions that contribute to ongoing HIV transmission among MSM.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To maximize public health impact and cost-effectiveness, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) must reach individuals at high HIV risk. Referrals for PrEP can be self- or provider-initiated, but there are several challenges to both. We assessed whether HIV risk differed by referral source among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex (gbMSM) screening for an HIV PrEP demonstration project., METHODS: PREPARATORY-5 was an open-label PrEP demonstration project enrolling gbMSM at high risk of HIV acquisition in Toronto, Canada. Study eligibility criteria related to high risk was defined as scoring >=10 on the HIV Incidence Risk Index for MSM (HIRI-MSM) and engaging in at least 1 act of condomless receptive anal sex within the past 6 months. Recruitment was promoted through self-referrals (ads in a sexual networking app and gay newspaper/website) and provider-referrals (10 community-based organizations, CBOs). HIV risk score (HIRI-MSM) and syndemic health burden were measured among gbMSM screened for study participation and compared according to referral source., RESULTS: Between October 16 and December 30, 2014, online ads generated 1518 click-throughs and CBOs referred 115 individuals. Overall, 165 men inquired about the trial, of which 86 underwent screening. The majority of screened men were self-referrals (60.5%), scored >=10 on HIRI-MSM (96.5%), and reported condomless receptive anal sex in the past 6 months (74.2%). Self- and provider-referrals had similarly high HIV risk profiles, with a median (IQR) HIRI-MSM score of 26.0 (19.0-32.5) and 28.5 (20.0-34.0) (p = 0.3), and 75.0% and 73.5% reporting condomless receptive anal sex (p = 0.9), respectively. The overall burden of syndemic health problems was also high, with approximately one-third overall identified as having depressive symptoms (39.5%), alcohol-related problems (39.5%), multiple drug use (31.4%), or sexual compulsivity (31.4%). There were no significant differences in syndemic health problems by referral source., CONCLUSIONS: HIV risk and syndemic burden were high among gbMSM presenting for this PrEP demonstration project regardless of referral source. Self-referral may be a useful and efficient strategy for identifying individuals suitable for PrEP use. Online strategies and CBOs working in gay men's health may play important roles in connecting individuals at high HIV risk to PrEP services., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02149888 .

N2  - BACKGROUND: Concurrent psychosocial problems may synergistically increase the risk of HIV infection (syndemics), representing a challenge for prevention. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and associated factors of syndemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) enrolled in the Brazilian pre-exposure prophylaxis demonstration study (PrEP Brasil Study)., METHODS: Secondary cross-sectional analysis of the PrEP Brasil Study was performed. Of 450 HIV-seronegative MSM/TGW enrolled in the PrEP Brasil Study- conducted at Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, Brazil- 421 participants with complete data were included in the present analysis. Syndemics was defined as occurrence of >=2 of the following conditions: polysubstance (>=2) use, binge drinking, positive depression screen, compulsive sexual behavior, and intimate partner violence (IPV)., RESULTS: The prevalence of recent polysubstance use was 22.8%, binge drinking 51.1%, positive depression screening 5.2%, compulsive sexual behavior 7.1%, and IPV 7.3%. Syndemics prevalence was 24.2%, and associated factors were younger age (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 0.95, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) 0.92-0.98 per year increase), TGW vs. MSM (aOR 3.09, 95% CI: 1.2-8.0), some college education or more vs. less than college (aOR 2.49, 95% CI: 1.31-4.75), and multiple male sexual partners in prior 3 months (aOR 1.69, 95% CI: 0.92-3.14)., CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of syndemics, particularly of polysubstance use and binge drinking, PrEP delivery offers an opportunity to diagnose and intervene in mental and social well-being.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - PURPOSE: Although strong evidence documents the elevated prevalence of both substance use and mental health problems among sexual minorities (i.e., gay, lesbian, and bisexuals), relatively less research has examined whether risk of the co-occurrence of these factors is elevated among sexual minorities compared to heterosexuals. The object of this study was to (1) explore sexual orientation-based differences in substance use, psychological distress, and their co-occurrence in a representative sample in Sweden, and (2) examine if greater exposure to stressors, such as discrimination, victimization/threats, and social isolation, could explain these potential disparities and their co-occurrence., METHODS: Data come from the cross-sectional Swedish National Public Health Survey, which collected random samples of individuals (16-84 years of age) annually from 2008 to 2015, with an overall response rate of 49.7% (n = 79,568 individuals; 1673 self-identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual). Population-level sexual orientation differences in substance use (i.e., alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis) and psychological distress were examined., RESULTS: Our findings showed significantly elevated prevalence of high-risk alcohol use, cannabis use, and daily tobacco smoking, among sexual minorities compared to heterosexuals. These substantial disparities in substance use more often co-occurred with psychological distress among sexual minorities than among heterosexuals. The elevated risk of co-occurring psychological distress and substance use was most notable among gay men relative to heterosexual men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.65, CI 1.98, 3.55), and bisexual women relative to heterosexual women (AOR = 3.01, CI 2.43, 3.72). Multiple mediation analyses showed that experiences of discrimination, victimization, and social isolation partially explained the sexual orientation disparity in these co-occurring problems., CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to a growing body of research showing that sexual minorities experience multiple threats to optimal health and points toward future interventions that address the shared sources of these overlapping health threats in stigma-related stress.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We applied syndemic theory to explore the degree to which syndemic conditions explain the syphilis epidemic affecting Canadian gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (GBMSM)., METHODS: Data from a national survey comprising 7872 GBMSM were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to measure associations between recent syphilis diagnosis (RSD; in previous 12 months) and the following variables: (1) sociodemographic information (sexuality, HIV status, age, income, ethnicity, relationship status), (2) antigay stigma (bullying, physical violence, sexual violence, career discrimination, health care discrimination), (3) syndemic conditions (suicidality, intimate partner violence, depression, illicit substance use, binge drinking), (4) sexual behaviors, (5) health care discrimination, and (6) the cumulative count of antigay experiences and syndemic conditions., RESULTS: Three percent (n = 235) of GBMSM surveyed reported an RSD. Men were more likely to report an RSD if they were HIV positive (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 6.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.66-8.43). Recent syphilis diagnosis was also positively associated with career discrimination, health care discrimination, substance use, and intimate partner violence. Furthermore, prevalence of RSD increased with each additional form of stigma or syndemic condition. The odds of reporting RSD was 5.2 (95% CI, 1.0-25.9) times higher for men who reported experiencing all 4 forms of antigay stigma compared with those who reported no stigma, after adjusting for sociodemographics. Similarly, the adjusted odds of reporting RSD was 12.2 (95% CI, 2.0%-74.8%) times higher for GBMSM experiencing 5 syndemic conditions compared with those reporting no syndemic conditions., CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this large cross-sectional study suggests that the Canadian syphilis epidemic among GBMSM is being driven by a syndemic constituted by multiple social and psychological conditions. Interventions addressing specific psychosocial health outcomes that increase the risk for syphilis should be developed and integrated within targeted sexual health services and syphilis prevention initiatives.

N2  - Despite decreased rates of HIV infection in Winnipeg, syphilis incidence continues to rise. Communities of men who have sex with men shoulder much of this burden of illness. This qualitative study aimed to better understand the co-evolution of HIV and syphilis in Winnipeg through a series of interviews with gay men. Eighteen individuals were recruited through advertising in sexual health centres and through subsequent snowball sampling. Thematic interpretive analysis and inductive reasoning were used to find individual and shared group meanings. We found that HIV formed the contextual ground on which sexual decision-making was made, with three main themes emerging during interviews: 1) bacterial STI transience being contrasted against HIV permanence; 2) syphilis being 'dirty' versus HIV carrying significant stigma, though being spared the label of uncleanliness; and 3) the role of pleasure and intimacy in sexual health decision-making. Based on these findings, we recommend further exploration to develop more effective strategies around syphilis prevention, in particular with regards to the longer-term illness ramifications and its relationship to HIV transmission.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined if methamphetamine use alone (METH + HIV-) and methamphetamine use in combination with HIV (METH + HIV+) were associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation as well as insulin resistance relative to a nonmethamphetamine-using, HIV-negative comparison group (METH-HIV-)., METHODS: Using an intact groups design, serum levels of HPA axis hormones in 46 METH + HIV- and 127 METH + HIV+ men who have sex with men (MSM) were compared to 136 METH-HIV- men., RESULTS: There were no group differences in prevailing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or cortisol levels, but the association between ACTH and cortisol was moderated by METH + HIV+ group (beta = -0.19, p < .05). Compared to METH-HIV- men, METH + HIV+ MSM displayed 10% higher log10 cortisol levels per standard deviation lower ACTH. Both groups of methamphetamine-using MSM had lower insulin resistance and greater syndemic burden (i.e., sleep disturbance, severe depression, childhood trauma, and polysubstance use disorder) compared to METH-HIV- men. However, the disaggregated functional relationship between ACTH and cortisol in METH + HIV+ MSM was independent of these factors., CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to characterize the bio-behavioral pathways that explain dysregulated HPA axis functioning in HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM.

N2  - We aimed to apply syndemic theory to verify the association and reinforcing effects between psychosocial problems and multiple sexual partners (MSP) of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Shanghai, China. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 547 MSM in Shanghai, China using a face-to-face survey. Sociodemographic and psychosocial data were collected, as well as information on MSP and condomless anal sex. In the 6 months prior to the survey, 54.3% of the MSM sample had had MSP. Univariate analysis showed that self-esteem, depression, loneliness, sexual compulsivity, and involuntary subordination (IS) were associated with MSP. Sexual compulsivity (multivariate odds ratio [ORm] = 2.94, 95% CI = 1.76-4.91) and IS (ORm = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.14-2.81) remained significant in multivariate analysis. MSM with five or more psychosocial problems had greater odds of (adjusted odds ratios = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.49-6.25) having MSP in the previous 6 months than the non-syndemic group. Our findings provide preliminary confirmation of the additive relationship of syndemic psychosocial health conditions and MSP among MSM in Shanghai, China. An integrated intervention with special focus on sexual compulsivity and IS is needed.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Efforts have been made to better understand sexual compulsivity by examining salient psychosocial syndemic correlates, though examination of such factors has yielded inconclusive results. Given that research on sexual compulsivity has predominately involved men who have sex with men (MSM), the aims of the current study were to establish the mean effect sizes of seven psychosocial syndemic indicators with sexual compulsivity, to determine if the effect varied as a function of the type of psychosocial syndemic, and investigate the potential moderating effects using MSM samples. A total of 95 studies were included for analyses among the psychosocial syndemic indicators of interest (i.e., depression, anxiety, alcohol use, drug use, intimate partner violence, childhood sexual abuse, and sexual risk behavior). Results revealed a medium mean effect size of sexual compulsivity, the strength of which was significantly moderated by type of psychosocial syndemic indicator. Significant mean effect sizes for all syndemic indicators on sexual compulsivity were found, with depression and anxiety having the strongest relationships; significant moderating effects were found and are discussed. Findings highlight clinical considerations regarding sexual compulsivity and its role within the HIV syndemic framework among MSM.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - There has been a steep rise in the use of drugs during sex (chemsex) by some men who have sex with men in economically developed countries, with associated increases in sexual risk for HIV and other STIs. This paper presents data from telephone interviews with 15 men attending sexual health clinics for post-exposure prophylaxis following a chemsex-related risk for HIV and discusses some of the theoretical approaches that have been employed to understand chemsex and inform interventions. Interviews were conducted as part of a larger intervention study, which used an adapted version of motivational Interviewing to explore risk behaviour and support change. Participants conceptualised their chemsex and HIV-related risks in a psycho-social context, highlighting the influences of psycho-socio-cultural challenges of homophobic marginalisation and the 'gay scene' on behaviour. Multiple influences of stigma, marginalisation, minority stress and maladaptive coping (including drug-use) contribute to syndemic 'risk-environments' and 'littoral spaces' in which chemsex and risk behaviours are played out.

N2  - Syndemics research has made great contributions to understanding sexual risk among Latino men who have sex with men. However, such work often combines data for behaviorally bisexual men with data for men with exclusively same-sex partners. Using cross-sectional data from 148 behaviorally bisexual Latino men, this study explored the impact of syndemic factors-polydrug use, childhood sexual abuse, and depression-on sexual risk behaviors and STI incidence. Approximately one-third of participants reported polydrug use, 22% reported childhood sexual abuse, and 26% screened for clinically significant depressive symptoms. An increase in syndemic factors was associated with increased odds of lifetime STI incidence and condomless receptive anal intercourse with men; however, the model did not predict condomless insertive anal intercourse with men or condomless vaginal intercourse. More efforts are needed to explore the varying mechanisms, including but not restricted to the combined impact of syndemic conditions, that influence sexual risk in this population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anal intraepithelial neoplasia is associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) as a precursor to anal cancer. However, factors other than hrHPV are likely to be involved and further study of cofactors is required because of the possibility of syndemic interactions., METHODS: Three hundred and fourteen patients underwent 457 operations. Histopathology and hrHPV testing using the Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC 2) method were performed. Demographic factors and sexually transmissible infections (STIs) were recorded., RESULTS: Results showed that hrHPV alone was associated with HSIL (OR = 4.65, p < 0.001). None of the other STIs were alone associated with HSIL but amplification of risk was found when hrHPV infection occurred with HIV (OR = 11.1); syphilis (OR = 5.58); HSV 2 (OR = 7.85); gonorrhoea (OR = 6.45) and some other infections., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that hrHPV is a sufficient cause of anal HSIL. Seropositivity for HIV, HSV 2, T. pallidum, HBV and HCV and a history of gonorrhoea or chlamydia exert a powerful amplifying factor increasing the risk of HSIL above the risk with hrHPV alone. Other co-factors which are associated with an increased risk of HSIL are increased age, male gender, MSM behaviour and self-reported history of more than 50 sexual partners. This pattern of disease in patients with warts is characteristic of a syndemic with potential serious increased risk of anal carcinoma. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - This paper measures syndemic substance use disorder, violence, and mental health and compares the syndemic among HIV-infected heterosexual men, heterosexual women, and men who have sex with men (MSM). Data were from a sample of high needs substance-using, HIV-infected people in South Florida between 2010 and 2012 (n = 481). We used confirmatory factor analysis to measure a syndemic latent variable and applied measurement invariance models to identify group differences in the data structure of syndemic co-morbidities among heterosexual men, heterosexual women, and MSM. We found that variables used to measure the syndemic fit each sub-group, supporting that substance use disorder, violence, and mental health coincide in HIV-infected individuals. Heterosexual men and MSM demonstrated similar syndemic latent variable factor loadings, but significantly different item intercepts, indicating that heterosexual men had larger mean values on substance use disorder, anxiety, and depression than MSM. Heterosexual men and heterosexual women demonstrated significantly different syndemic variable factor loadings, indicating that anxiety and depression contribute more (and substance use contributes less) to the syndemic in heterosexual men compared to heterosexual women. MSM and heterosexual women demonstrated similar syndemic latent variable factor loadings and intercepts, but had significantly different factor residual variances indicating more variance in violent victimization and depression for MSM and more variance in stress for heterosexual women than what is captured by the observed syndemic indicators. Furthermore, heterosexual women had a larger syndemic factor mean than MSM, indicating that the syndemic burden is greater among heterosexual women than MSM. Our findings support that measurement invariance can elucidate differences in the syndemic to tailor interventions to sub-group needs.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Stigma and discrimination contribute to elevated depression risks among sexual minority women (SMW) and gender minority (GM) people who identify as lesbian, bisexual, or queer. Syndemics theory posits that adverse psychosocial outcomes cluster to negatively impact health and mental health outcomes among sexual minorities. We tested whether a syndemic condition composed of low social support, low self-rated health, low self-esteem, and economic insecurity mediated the relationship between sexual stigma and depressive symptoms among SMW/GM., METHODS: We implemented a cross-sectional, Internet-based survey with SMW and GM in Toronto, Canada. We conducted structural equation modeling using maximum likelihood estimation to test a conceptual model of pathways between sexual stigma, syndemic factors, and depressive symptoms., RESULTS: A total of 391 SMW/GM with a mean age of 30.9 (SD = 7.62) were included in the analysis. The model fit for a latent syndemics construct consisting of psychosocial variables (low social support, low self-rated health, low self-esteem, economic insecurity) was very good (chi2 = 6.022, df = 2, p = .049; comparative fit index = 0.973, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.918, root-mean square error of approximation = 0.072). In the simultaneous model, sexual stigma had a significant direct effect on depression. When the syndemic variable was added as a mediator, the direct path from sexual stigma to depression was no longer significant, suggesting mediation. The model fit the data well: chi2 = 33.50, df = 12, p = .001; comparative fit index = 0.951, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.915, root-mean square error of approximation = 0.068., CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the salience of considering both sexual stigma and syndemic factors to explain mental health disparities experienced by SMW and GM. Addressing sexual stigma in the context of co-occurring psychosocial factors and economic insecurity will be key to achieving optimal health for SMW and GM.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) constitute a risk group for sexual transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. Despite counselling interventions, risk behaviour remains high. Syndemic theory holds that psychosocial problems often co-occur, interact and mutually reinforce each other, thereby increasing high risk behaviours and co-occurring diseases. Therefore, if co-occurring psychosocial problems were assessed and treated simultaneously, this might decrease high risk behaviour and disease., METHOD: An open label randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 150 MSM with high risk behaviour recruited from the STI clinic of Amsterdam. Inclusion criteria are: HIV negative MSM with two STI and/or PEP treatment in the last 24 months, or HIV positive MSM with one STI in the last 24 months. All participants get questionnaires on the following syndemic domains: ADHD, depression, anxiety disorder, alexithymia and sex- and drug addiction. Participants in the control group receive standard care: STI screenings every three months and motivational interviewing based counselling. Participants in the experimental group receive standard care plus feedback based on the results of the questionnaires. All participants can be referred to co-located mental health or addiction services. The primary outcome is help seeking behaviour for mental health problems and/or drug use problems. The secondary outcomes are STI incidence and changes in sexual risk behaviour (i.e. condom use, number of anal sex partners, drug use during sex)., DISCUSSION: This study will provide information on syndemic domains among MSM who show high risk behaviour and on the effect of screening and referral on help seeking behaviour and health (behaviour) outcomes., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial Registration at clinicaltrail.gov, identifier NCT02859935 .

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The syndemics framework has been used to explain the high rates of HIV infection among gay and bisexual men. However, most studies have relied primarily on urban or otherwise limited (e.g., single location) samples. We evaluated the prevalence of syndemics-here, depression, polydrug use, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and sexual compulsivity-among gay and bisexual men from across the United States, including nonurban areas., METHOD: Using data from a national sample of 1,033 HIV-negative gay and bisexual men, demographic differences in the prevalence of each syndemic condition and associations with HIV transmission risk behavior were examined., RESULTS: More than 62% of men reported at least 1 syndemic condition. Prevalence did not vary by U.S. region-however, a larger proportion of nonurban men and those with lower income and education levels were above the median number of syndemic conditions. In bivariate analyses, HIV transmission risk behavior was associated with each syndemic condition except for childhood sexual abuse, whereas in multivariate analyses, it was associated with polydrug use, sexual compulsivity, being Latino, and being single and was highest among those reporting 3 or more syndemic conditions., CONCLUSIONS: Rates of syndemic conditions among this national sample of gay and bisexual men were generally comparable to previous studies, however elevated rates in nonurban men suggest the need for targeted intervention and support. Links observed between syndemics and HIV transmission risk behavior highlight the ongoing need to address psychosocial concerns among gay and bisexual men in order to reduce their disproportionately high rates of HIV infection.

N2  - Life history interviews were conducted with 40 gay and bisexual men to identify modes of syndemic experience and risk practice. Out of the interview narratives emerged one major and two minor modes of developmental pathway whereby syndemic conditions are navigated and expressed: (1) a combination of adverse childhood events with later episodes of depression and/or substantial substance use; (2) personal disruption that led to periods of depression and anxiety associated with the stresses of migration; and (3) a disorientation and an unravelling of life trajectory in the transition from family of origin to college or work. Risk practices fell into three high-risk modes: active and frequent engagement in condomless sex; unassertive deferment to a partner's initiation of condomless sex; and episodic risk combined with a risk reduction strategy. Three low risk modes were also identified: no recent condomlessness but multiple risk history in interview; a trajectory over time from high to low risk; and consistent low risk practice. These different modes of syndemic experience and risk management may have implications for identification of the effective HIV prevention tools that work best for different sets of men.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Studies have found that gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) have higher rates of mental health conditions and substance use than heterosexual men, but are limited by issues of representativeness., OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and correlates of mental health disorders among GBM in Metro Vancouver, Canada., METHODS: From 2012 to 2014, the Momentum Health Study recruited GBM (>=16 years) via respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to estimate population parameters. Computer-assisted self-interviews (CASI) collected demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral information, while nurse-administered structured interviews asked about mental health diagnoses and treatment. Multivariate logistic regression using manual backward selection was used to identify covariates for any lifetime doctor diagnosed: (1) alcohol/substance use disorder and (2) any other mental health disorder., RESULTS: Of 719 participants, 17.4% reported a substance use disorder and 35.2% reported any other mental health disorder; 24.0% of all GBM were currently receiving treatment. A lifetime substance use disorder diagnosis was negatively associated with being a student (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 0.27-0.99) and an annual income >=$30,000 CAD (AOR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21-0.67) and positively associated with HIV-positive serostatus (AOR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.63-3.96), recent crystal methamphetamine use (AOR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.69-4.40) and recent heroin use (AOR = 5.59, 95% CI: 2.39-13.12). Any other lifetime mental health disorder diagnosis was negatively associated with self-identifying as Latin American (AOR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.08-0.81), being a refugee or visa holder (AOR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05-0.65), and living outside Vancouver (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.33-0.82), and positively associated with abnormal anxiety symptomology scores (AOR = 3.05, 95% CI: 2.06-4.51)., CONCLUSIONS: Mental health conditions and substance use, which have important implications for clinical and public health practice, were highly prevalent and co-occurring.

T1  - HIV risk behaviours among immigrant and ethnic minority gay and bisexual men in North America and Europe: A systematic review.
A1  - Lewis, Nathaniel M
A1  - Wilson, Kathi
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - HIV surveillance systems show that gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a disproportionate burden of HIV in North American and European countries. Within the MSM category, HIV prevalence is often elevated among ethnic minority (i.e., Latino, Asian, and Black) MSM, many of whom are also foreign-born immigrants. Little research has focused specifically on foreign-born populations, though studies that provide data on the nativity of their samples offer an opportunity to investigate the potential role of transnational migration in informing HIV risk among ethnic minority MSM. This systematic review of ethnic minority MSM studies where the nativity of the sample is known provides a robust alternative to single studies measuring individual-level predictors of HIV risk behaviour. In this review, HIV prevalence, unprotected sex, drug use, and HIV testing are analysed in relation to the ethnicity, nativity, and location of the samples included. The results, which include high rates of HIV, unprotected sex, and stimulant use in foreign-born Latino samples and high rates of alcohol and club drug use in majority foreign-born Asian Pacific Islander (API) samples, provide baseline evidence for the theory of migration and HIV risk as syndemics within ethnic minority populations in North American and European countries. The findings also suggest that further research on the contextual factors influencing HIV risk among ethnic minority MSM groups and especially immigrants within these groups is needed. These factors include ethnic networks, individual post-migration transitions, and the gay communities and substance use cultures in specific destination cities. Further comparative work may also reveal how risk pathways differ across ethnic groups. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Syndemics of illicit drug use and HIV remain as significant public health issues around the world. There has been increasing concern regarding the rapidly growing market of new psychoactive substances, particularly in Asia. In response, the Japanese government has increasingly banned such substances in recent years. We sought to identify the prevalence and correlates of use of quasi-legal psychoactive substances among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in Japan., METHODS: Data were derived from a nationwide survey of PLHIV conducted at nine leading HIV/AIDS care hospitals between July and December 2013. The prevalence and correlates of the use of quasi-legal psychoactive substances (e.g., synthetic cannabinoids, cathinone derivatives, etc. that had not been prohibited from using at the time of survey) among male participants were examined using multivariate survey logistic regression., RESULTS: Among 963 study participants, the majority (95.3%) were male. The most commonly used drug among men was quasi-legal psychoactive substances (55.3% ever and 12.8% in the previous year). In multivariate analysis, the lifetime use of tryptamine-type derivatives (i.e., 5-MeO-DIPT or N,N-diisopropyl-5-methoxytryptamine) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.36-4.28) and methamphetamine/amphetamine (AOR: 3.59; 95% CI: 2.13-6.04) were independently associated with recent quasi-legal psychoactive substance use., CONCLUSIONS: In our sample of male PLHIV in Japan, quasi-legal psychoactive substances were the most commonly used drugs. Individuals who had ever used tryptamine-type derivatives or methamphetamine/amphetamine were more likely to report recent quasi-legal psychoactive substance use, suggesting a potential shift in drug use patterns from regulated to unregulated substances among this population. These findings indicate a need for further research to examine implications for HIV care.

The present study aimed to apply the syndemic theory to verify the reinforcing effects of psychosocial problems on unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) among MSM in Shanghai, and determine if other important psychosocial factors fit into the syndemic theory., METHODS: Data were collected from 547 MSM in Shanghai, China, through face-to-face interviews. The measures for psychosocial problems included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale; the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale; and the Sexual Compulsivity Scale. We used multivariate analysis and binary logistic regression to investigate the associations between psychosocial problems and high-risk sexual behaviors., RESULTS: The prevalence of UAI among MSM in the past 6 months was 54.5%. Education (graduate from college vs. high school) served as a protective factor against UAI (OR 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38-0.94). There was a high prevalence of psychosocial problems, and at least one-third of participants reported experiencing more than two psychosocial symptoms. Of these psychosocial factors that we investigated, lower self-esteem was associated with UAI in both univariate and multivariate regression model (P = 0.009). Result suggests that overlapping and reinforcing effects of psychosocial problems may increase high risk sexual behaviors among MSM in Shanghai, China (OR 1.65, 95% CI: 1.09-2.50; P = 0.018)., CONCLUSIONS: We found further evidence for a syndemic of psychosocial problems among MSM in Shanghai, China. This syndemic may also increase high risk sexual behaviors among MSM. Most HIV prevention interventions are focused on behavior change and only have moderate effects; our findings suggest that a shift from behavior-focused interventions to a more comprehensive strategy that addresses psychosocial factors may be necessary.

N2  - Syndemics research shows the additive effect of psychosocial problems on high-risk sexual behavior among gay and bisexual men (GBM). Psychosocial strengths may predict less engagement in high-risk sexual behavior. In a study of 470 ethnically diverse HIV-negative GBM, regression models were computed using number of syndemic psychosocial problems, number of psychosocial strengths, and serodiscordant condomless anal sex (CAS). The number of syndemic psychosocial problems correlated with serodiscordant CAS (RR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.18-1.92; p = 0.001). When adding the number of psychosocial strengths to the model, the effect of syndemic psychosocial problems became non-significant, but the number of strengths-based factors remained significant (RR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.86; p = 0.002). Psychosocial strengths may operate additively in the same way as syndemic psychosocial problems, but in the opposite direction. Consistent with theories of resilience, psychosocial strengths may be an important set of variables predicting sexual risk behavior that is largely missing from the current HIV behavioral literature.

N2  - Parental mental health may be a critical component in understanding the overlapping health burdens of mental health symptomatology and drug use in young men who have sex with men (YMSM), yet studies of YMSM have not fully examined these associations. To understand these relationships, data drawn from a study of gay, bisexual, and other YMSM were used to examine associations between perceived parental psychopathology and the health of YMSM. Findings suggest that YMSM reporting at least one parent with perceived depression, manic depression, schizophrenia, or antisocial behavior anytime during their childhoods were more likely to report higher levels of both depressive symptomatology and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than those reporting no perception of any of these psychopathologies in their parents. Number of different drugs used in one's life were higher among participants who perceived at least one parent as depressed. Mediation analyses indicated that the relationship between perceived parental depression and lifetime drug use of YMSM was mediated both by YMSM depression and YMSM PTSD. These results suggest that parental psychopathology plays an important role in the health of sexual minority men, a population with elevated levels of mental health burden and drug use across the lifespan.

N2  - Most HIV prevention for sexual minority men and men who have sex with men targets risk behaviors (e.g., condom use) and helps <50% of participants. Bolstering resilience might increase HIV prevention's effectiveness. This systematic review identified resilience resources (protective factors) in high-risk, HIV-negative, sexual minority men. We reviewed PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, references, and Listservs for studies including sexual minority men with 1+ HIV risk factor (syndemics): childhood sexual abuse, partner abuse, substance abuse, or mental health symptoms. From 1356 articles screened, 20 articles met inclusion criteria. Across the articles, we identified and codified 31 resilience resources: socioeconomic (e.g., employment), behavioral coping strategies (e.g., mental health treatment), cognitions/emotions (e.g., acceptance), and relationships. Resilience resources were generally associated with lower HIV risk; there were 18 low-risk associations, 4 high-risk associations, 8 non-significant associations). We generated a set of empirically based resilience variables and a hypothesis to be evaluated further to improve HIV prevention.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has emerged as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention tool for populations at highest risk for HIV infection. Current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for identifying PrEP candidates may not be specific enough to identify gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at the highest risk for HIV infection. We created an HIV risk score for HIV-negative MSM based on Syndemics Theory to develop a more targeted criterion for assessing PrEP candidacy., METHODS: Behavioral risk assessment and HIV testing data were analyzed for HIV-negative MSM attending the Los Angeles LGBT Center between January 2009 and June 2014 (n = 9481). Syndemics Theory informed the selection of variables for a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Estimated coefficients were summed to create an HIV risk score, and model fit was compared between our model and CDC guidelines using the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion., RESULTS: Approximately 51% of MSM were above a cutpoint that we chose as an illustrative risk score to qualify for PrEP, identifying 75% of all seroconverting MSM. Our model demonstrated a better overall fit when compared with the CDC guidelines (Akaike Information Criterion Difference = 68) in addition to identifying a greater proportion of HIV infections., CONCLUSIONS: Current CDC PrEP guidelines should be expanded to incorporate substance use, partner-level, and other Syndemic variables that have been shown to contribute to HIV acquisition. Deployment of such personalized algorithms may better hone PrEP criteria and allow providers and their patients to make a more informed decision prior to PrEP use.

N2  - Young men who have sex with men continue to be highly affected by HIV. To improve understanding of the role that multiple co-occurring health issues (i.e., syndemics) play in HIV acquisition, sophisticated modeling methods are needed. The purpose of this study was to use structural equation modeling to understand the structure of the syndemic and to test its longitudinal association with condomless anal sex. Data are from a longitudinal study of 450 YMSM. A primary syndemic component comprised of substance use, violence, and internalizing mental health factors significantly predicted the number of condomless anal sex partners in the full sample. Analyses exploring associations by race/ethnicity found a significant association among White YMSM, but not among Black or Latino YMSM. Higher-order factor modeling suggests these psychosocial factors form a syndemic in all racial/ethnic groups, but the syndemic, as conceptualized here, may be less relevant to racial/ethnic minority YMSM.

N2  - Identifying risk and protective factors associated with condomless sex among youth living with HIV is imperative for developing effective HIV prevention strategies. A cross-sectional sample of 1728 participants, 12-26 years of age, recruited from adolescent medicine clinics in 17 U.S. cities completed an audio-computer assisted self-interview with questions about their substance use, psychosocial factors, and attitudinal and behavioral factors. Guided by syndemics theory, a path analysis was used to assess the interrelations of these factors. Analyses of model fit statistics indicated statistically significant direct pathways between substance use, psychosocial factors, self-efficacy for risk-reduction, alternative risk-reduction attitudes and behaviors and condomless sex. The total indirect effect of self-efficacy for risk-reduction on condomless sex through alternative risk-reduction attitudes and behaviors was also significant. Multi-faceted, tailored interventions that address individual risk and protective factors and their combined synergistic effects are urgently needed to prevent condomless sex among this population.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Public health efforts focused on Latina youth sexuality are most commonly framed by the syndemic of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, a narrow and often heteronormative focus that perpetuates silences that contribute to health inequities and overlooks the growing need for increased education, awareness, and support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. This article presents findings from the project Let's Talk About Sex: Digital Storytelling for Puerto Rican Latina Youth, which used a culturally centered, narrative-based approach for analyzing participants' own specifications of sexual values and practices. The strength of digital storytelling lies in its utility as an innovative tool for community-based and culturally situated research, as well as in its capacity to open up new spaces for health communication. Here we present two "coming out" case studies to illustrate the value of digital storytelling in supporting the development of meaningful and culturally relevant health promotion efforts for LGBTQ-identified Puerto Rican Latina youth across the life span.

N2  - Though functional social support has been shown to serve as a protective factor for HIV viral load suppression in other populations, scant research has examined this relationship among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. We assessed characteristics of social support, effects of social support on HIV viral load, and moderation by social support of the relationship between psychosocial indicators of a synergistic epidemic (syndemic) and HIV viral load. We analyzed longitudinal data from HIV-positive MSM using antiretroviral therapy who were enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study between 2002 and 2009 (n = 712). First, we conducted reliability assessments of a one-item social support measure. Then, we conducted a series of generalized longitudinal mixed models to assess our research questions. Moderation was assessed using an interaction term. A three-level (low/medium/high) social support variable demonstrated high reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.75). Black and Hispanic MSM reported lower social support than their White counterparts (p < .0001). Recent sero-conversion was associated with higher social support (p < .05). Higher numbers of concomitant syndemic indicators (depression, polysubstance use, and condomless anal sex) were associated with lower social support (p < .0001). Medium and high social support levels were associated with greater viral load suppression and lower viral load means (p < .0001). Social support moderated the relationships between syndemic and HIV viral load (p < .05). HIV-positive MSM, particularly those of color, may benefit greatly from interventions that can successfully boost functional social support. Creating strengths-based interventions may also have particularly high impact among HIV-positive MSM with the highest psychosocial burdens.

N2  - Sexual violence among men who have sex with men (MSM) is prevalent in developing countries and is associated with increased HIV/STI risk. Despite high HIV prevalence (20 %) among MSM in Tijuana, Mexico, little attention has been paid to the occurrence of sexual violence in this high-risk group. The present study used a syndemic conditions framework to examine correlates of sexual violence victimization in a sample of 201 MSM surveyed in Tijuana, Mexico during 2012 and 2013. Participants were recruited through respondent-driven sampling and underwent a 2-h baseline interview and testing for HIV and syphilis. Sexual violence was defined as any incident during the past year in which the participant had been raped, sexually molested, or sexually harassed. The majority of participants self-identified as gay or bisexual, had never married, were employed, and had a high school education or greater. The average age was 29.7 years. Thirty-nine percent reported sexual violence in the past year. A hierarchical multiple linear regression model predicting more experiences of sexual violence was tested. In a final model, a higher number of experiences of sexual violence was associated with a history of childhood sexual abuse, more adult experiences of homophobia, more depression and hostility symptoms, and not living with a spouse or steady partner. The findings from this study support a model of co-occurring psychosocial factors that increase the likelihood of sexual violence experiences among MSM. Multi-level approaches to the prevention of childhood and adult experiences of sexual violence and homophobia are needed to avert the development of adverse mental and physical health outcomes associated with sexual violence victimization.

N2  - Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect men who have sex with men, with marked increases in most STIs in recent years. These are likely underpinned by coterminous increases in behavioural risks which have coincided with the development of Internet and geospatial sociosexual networking. Current guidelines advocate regular, annual sexually transmitted infection testing amongst sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM), as opposed to symptom-driven testing. This paper explores sexually transmitted infection testing regularity amongst MSM who use social and sociosexual media. Data were collected from 2668 men in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, recruited via social and gay sociosexual media. Only one-third of participants report regular (yearly or more frequent) STI testing, despite relatively high levels of male sex partners, condomless anal intercourse and high-risk unprotected anal intercourse. The following variables were associated with regular STI testing; being more 'out' (adjusted odds ratio = 1.79; confidence interval = 1.20-2.68), HIV-positive (adjusted odds ratio = 14.11; confidence interval = 7.03-28.32); reporting >=10 male sex partners (adjusted odds ratio = 2.15; confidence interval = 1.47-3.14) or regular HIV testing (adjusted odds ratio = 48.44; confidence interval = 28.27-83.01). Men reporting long-term sickness absence from work/carers (adjusted odds ratio = 0.03; confidence interval = 0.00-0.48) and men aged <=25 years (adjusted odds ratio = 0.36; 95% confidence interval = 0.19-0.69) were less likely to test regularly for STIs. As such, we identify a complex interplay of social, health and behavioural factors that each contribute to men's STI testing behaviours. In concert, these data suggest that the syndemics placing men at elevated risk may also mitigate against access to testing and prevention services. Moreover, successful reduction of STI transmission amongst MSM will necessitate a comprehensive range of approaches which address these multiple interrelated factors that underpin MSM's STI testing.

N2  - To date, various dimensions of body image and their associations with condom use have not been studied among men who have sex with men (MSM) who use geosocial-networking smartphone applications ("apps") to meet new sexual partners. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate associations between weight perception, body dissatisfaction, and self-objectification with sexual behaviors among a sample of MSM (N = 92) recruited from Grindr, an app popular among MSM, to complete an online survey. Obese participants scored significantly higher on measures of body dissatisfaction and lower on measures of sexual sensation seeking. Decreased propensities to seek sexual sensations were associated with fewer sexual partners. By assessing associations between dimensions of body dissatisfaction and sexual risk behaviors, this study adds support to a theory of syndemics among MSM, which suggests that synergistically related biological, psychological, social, and behavioral factors disproportionately affect health and health-related behaviors in this population.

N2  - We examined the presence and co-occurrence of psychosocial health conditions (depression, frequent alcohol use, and victimisation) among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender (TG) women in India, and their cumulative association with sexual risk. A survey questionnaire was administered among a convenience sample of 600 participants (MSM = 300; TG women = 300) recruited through six non-governmental organisations in four states. Prevalences of the number of psychosocial health conditions among MSM were: none = 31.3%, one = 43%, two = 20%, and three = 5.7%; and among TG women: none = 9%; one = 35.33%, two = 38.33%, and three = 17.33%. In bivariate and multivariate models, these conditions were positively and additively related to sexual risk, providing evidence for a syndemic of psychosocial health conditions among MSM and TG women and their synergistic effect on sexual risk. In addition to the number of syndemic conditions, resilient coping and social support were significant predictors of sexual risk among MSM and TG women, respectively. HIV preventive interventions in India should screen for and address co-occurring psychosocial health conditions - experiences of violence, mental health issues, and alcohol use - among MSM and TG women.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are a risk group for new HIV infections. Drug use among men who have sex with men is often accompanied by risky sexual behaviours. Local AIDS help centres and gay advice centres are recording an increase in drug use among MSM clients in Germany. This study examines reasons for drug use and drug use contexts for MSM, including syndemic factors and experiences of social support., METHODS: The study is based on a qualitative research approach. We conducted 14 structured, in-depth interviews with substance-using MSM in three German cities. An interview guidance document was used that was developed on the basis of the syndemic approach. Data analysis was based on structured analysis of content., RESULTS: The MSM interviewed had extensive experience of drug use, in particular amyl nitrate, amphetamines, methamphetamine, ketamine, cocaine and cannabis. The drugs were used both at parties and in connection with sexual experiences (chemsex). Twelve men said that they had an existing HIV infection at the time of the interview. The men also reported experiences of violence and discrimination because of their sexual orientation. The social networks of the MSM and dating apps are highly relevant for experiencing chemsex. Certain places in the MSM community also have an impact on drug purchase, drug consumption and chemsex sessions., CONCLUSIONS: MSM are a group that is vulnerable to psychological problems, in particular problematic drug use. This group requires specific help from drug services and AIDS support services that are orientated towards the life situation and substance use contexts of the clients. Both support systems should work together more closely and network. Furthermore, specific prevention strategies, aimed at both mental and physical well-being, should be developed for substance-using MSM.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Syndemic theory has been proposed as a framework for understanding the role of multiple risk factors driving the HIV epidemic among sexual and gender minority individuals. As yet, the framework has been relatively absent in research on Latinos/as., METHODS: We used logistic regression to assess relationships among cumulative syndemic conditions - including clinically significant depression, high-risk alcohol consumption, discrimination, and childhood sexual abuse - engagement with multiple partners and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) in a sample of 176 Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City., RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, an increase in the number of syndemic factors experienced was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting multiple partners and CAI. In multivariable analyses, participants with 2, 3, and 4 factors were significantly more likely to report multiple partners than those with 0 (aOR=4.66, 95% CI [1.29, 16.85); aOR=7.28, 95% CI [1.94, 27.28] and aOR=8.25, 95% CI [1.74, 39.24] respectively; p<0.05. Regarding CAI, only participants with 3 and 4 factors differed from those with 0 aOR=7.35, 95% CI [1.64, 32.83] and OR=8.06, 95% CI [1.39, 46.73] respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive approaches that address syndemic factors, and capitalize on resiliency, are needed to address the sexual health needs of Latino MSM.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Transgender populations have been underrepresented in HIV epidemiologic studies and consequently in HIV prevention, care, and treatment programs. Since 2012, there has been a dramatic increase in research focused on transgender people. Studies highlight the burden of HIV and risk determinants, including intersecting stigmas, as drivers of syndemics among transgender populations. This review synthesizes the most recent global epidemiology of HIV infection and describes current gaps in research and interventions to inform prioritization of HIV research for transgender populations., METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of the medical literature published between January 1, 2012 and November 30, 2015. The data focused on HIV prevalence, determinants of risk, and syndemics among transgender populations., RESULTS: Estimates varied dramatically by location and subpopulation. Transfeminine individuals have some of the highest concentrated HIV epidemics in the world with laboratory-confirmed prevalence up to 40%. Data were sparse among trans masculine individuals; however, they suggest potential increased risk for trans masculine men who have sex with men (MSM). No prevalence data were available for transgender people across Sub-Saharan Africa or Eastern Europe/Central Asia. Emerging data consistently support the association of syndemic conditions with HIV risk in transgender populations., DISCUSSION: Addressing syndemic conditions and gender-specific challenges is critical to ensure engagement and retention in HIV prevention by transgender populations. Future research should prioritize: filling knowledge gaps in HIV epidemiology; elucidating how stigma shapes syndemic factors to produce HIV and other deleterious effects on transgender health; and understanding how to effectively implement HIV interventions for transgender people.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Bisexual populations have higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, suicidality and substance use than heterosexuals, and often than gay men or lesbians. The co-occurrence of multiple outcomes has rarely been studied., METHODS: Data were collected from 405 bisexuals using respondent-driven sampling. Weighted analyses were conducted for 387 with outcome data. Multiple outcomes were defined as 3 or more of: depression, anxiety, suicide ideation, problematic alcohol use, or polysubstance use., RESULTS: Among bisexuals, 19.0 % had multiple outcomes. We did not find variation in raw frequency of multiple outcomes across sociodemographic variables (e.g. gender, age). After adjustment, gender and sexual orientation identity were associated, with transgender women and those identifying as bisexual only more likely to have multiple outcomes. Social equity factors had a strong impact in both crude and adjusted analysis: controlling for other factors, high mental health/substance use burden was associated with greater discrimination (prevalence risk ratio (PRR) = 5.71; 95 % CI: 2.08, 15.63) and lower education (PRR = 2.41; 95 % CI: 1.06, 5.49), while higher income-to-needs ratio was protective (PRR = 0.44; 0.20, 1.00)., CONCLUSIONS: Mental health and substance use outcomes with high prevalence among bisexuals frequently co-occurred. We find some support for the theory that these multiple outcomes represent a syndemic, defined as co-occurring and mutually reinforcing adverse outcomes driven by social inequity.

N2  - Because problematic patterns of alcohol and other substance use are prevalent drivers of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, comprehensive interventions are needed for substance-using men who have sex with men (SUMSM). We conducted a systematic review of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioral interventions for reducing condomless anal intercourse (CAI) in SUMSM. Three RCTs observed that cognitive behavioral or motivational interviewing interventions achieved a 24% to 40% decrease in CAI. Interventions also tended to demonstrate greater efficacy for reducing CAI and substance use among those who had lower severity of substance use disorder symptoms. Although behavioral interventions for SUMSM are one potentially important component of biobehavioral HIV/AIDS prevention, further research is needed to examine whether integrative approaches that cultivate resilience and target co-occurring syndemic conditions demonstrate greater efficacy. Multilevel intervention approaches are also needed to optimize the effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis and HIV treatment as prevention with SUMSM.

N2  - Young Black gay/bisexual men (YBGBM) are affected by contextual stressors-namely syndemic conditions and minority stress-that threaten their health and well-being. Resilience is a process through which YBGBM achieve positive psychosocial outcomes in the face of adverse conditions. Self-efficacy, hardiness and adaptive coping, and social support may be important resilience factors for YBGBM. This study explores different profiles of these resilience factors in 228 YBGBM in New York City and compares profiles on psychological distress, mental health, and other psychosocial factors. Four profiles of resilience were identified: (a) Low self-efficacy and hardiness/adaptive coping (23.5%); (b) Low peer and parental support (21.2%); (c) High peer support, low father support (34.5%); and (d) High father and mother support, self-efficacy, and hardiness/adaptive coping (20.8%). YBGBM in profile 1 scored markedly higher on distress (d = .74) and lower on mental health functioning (d = .93) compared to men in the other profiles. Results suggest that self-efficacy and hardiness/adaptive coping may play a more important role in protecting YBGBM from risks compared to social support and should be targeted in interventions. The findings show that resilience is a multidimensional construct and support the notion that there are different patterns of resilience among YBGBM.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - We examined resilience associated with the avoidance of psychosocial health conditions (i.e., syndemics) that increase vulnerability for HIV among young Black gay and bisexual men. We used analytic induction to compare a sample of 23 men who showed no evidence of syndemic conditions to a sample of 23 men who experienced syndemic conditions. The men who avoided syndemics reported supportive relationships with people who helped them to develop a strong sense of identity, provided them with opportunities to give back to their communities, and promoted positive norms about health. In contrast, the men experiencing syndemic conditions described numerous instances of trauma and oppression that infringed upon their desire to form positive relationships. Among these men, experiences of oppression were associated with shame, identity incongruence, social isolation, relational disconnection, mistrust of men, and expectations of further marginalization. We examined participants' experiences through the framework of the psychosocial sense of community. Results of this study provide evidence for using strength-based intervention strategies to prevent syndemic conditions. Findings suggest that to attenuate socio-structural barriers to health and comorbid psychosocial health concerns, interventions must address young men's social isolation and promote positive identity and sense of community.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States have a 50% greater incidence of HIV when compared with White MSM. Previous studies have analyzed factors contributing to condomless anal intercourse among Latino MSM, but few studies have followed cohorts of HIV-negative Latino MSM to determine circumstances for HIV infection. Informed by Syndemics theory, we examine behavioral, biological, and contextual factors associated with HIV infection for Latino MSM., METHODS: Risk assessment and HIV testing data were analyzed for all initially HIV negative, Latino MSM (n = 3111) visiting a community-based clinic in Los Angeles, CA from January 2009 to June 2014. Survival analyses were used to determine characteristics of Latino MSM who became HIV positive during the study time frame., RESULTS: Similar to previous studies of MSM, self-reported history of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and/or syphilis (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.97; CI: 1.28 to 3.04), receptive condomless anal intercourse (aHR: 1.7; CI: 1.16 to 2.49), and methamphetamine use (aHR: 1.99; CI: 1.15 to 3.43) predicted HIV infection. In addition, originating from Central America (aHR: 2.31; CI: 1.41 to 3.79), Latino ethnicity of the last sex partner (aHR: 1.67; CI: 1.16 to 2.39) and experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) (aHR: 1.73; CI: 1.13 to 2.64) were also associated with HIV infection among Latino MSM., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show independent associations between IPV and HIV infection among Latino MSM. This study shows that psychosocial conditions such as IPV fuel HIV incidence among Latino MSM, and psychosocial interventions should be considered to reduce HIV disparities among Latino MSM.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to confirm the substance abuse, violence, HIV, and depression syndemic among Hispanic men, and to test whether stress and sociocultural factors, including acculturation, family support, and sexual orientation, predict this syndemic., METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was administered to 164 Hispanic men using standardized measures for Hispanic Stress (Cervantes, Padilla, & Salgado de Snyder, 1991), substance abuse (Kelly et al., 1994), violence (Peragallo et al., 2005), risk for HIV (Gonzalez-Guarda, Peragallo, Urrutia, Vasquez, & Mitrani, 2008), and depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Scale, CES-D; Radloff, 1977)., RESULTS: Results from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) supported the syndemic factor among Hispanic men. While family/cultural stress and homosexual identity were risk factors for the syndemic factor, family support was protective., CONCLUSIONS: More longitudinal research is needed to identify influences on the syndemic factor among diverse Hispanic communities. Interventions that address stress and enhance family supports may show promise in addressing and preventing syndemics among Hispanic men.

N2  - Syndemic theory posits that epidemics of multiple physical and psychosocial problems co-occur among disadvantaged groups due to adverse social conditions. Although sexual minority populations are often stigmatized and vulnerable to multiple health problems, the syndemic perspective has been underutilized in understanding chronic disease. To assess the potential utility of this perspective in understanding the management of co-occurring HIV and Type 2 diabetes, we used linear regression to examine glycemic control (A1c) among men who have sex with men (MSM) with both HIV and Type 2 diabetes (n = 88). Bivariable linear regression explored potential syndemic correlates of inadequate glycemic control. Compared to those with adequate glycemic control (A1c <= 7.5 %), more men with inadequate glycemic control (A1c > 7.5 %) had hypertension (70 vs. 46 %, p = 0.034), high triglycerides (93 vs. 61 %, p = 0.002), depression (67 vs. 39 %, p = 0.018), current substance abuse (15 vs. 2 %, p = 0.014), and detectable levels of HIV (i.e., viral load >=75 copies per ml blood; 30 vs. 10 %, p = 0.019). In multivariable regression controlling for age, the factors that were independently associated with higher A1c were high triglycerides, substance use, and detectable HIV viral load, suggesting that chronic disease management among MSM is complex and challenging for patients and providers. Findings also suggest that syndemic theory can be a clarifying lens for understanding chronic disease management among sexual minority stigmatized populations. Interventions targeting single conditions may be inadequate when multiple conditions co-occur; thus, research using a syndemic framework may be helpful in identifying intervention strategies that target multiple co-occurring conditions.

N2  - Latin America has some of the highest levels of antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage of any developing region in the world. Early initiation and optimal adherence to ART are necessary for improved health outcomes and reduction in onward transmission. Previous work has demonstrated the role of psychosocial problems as barriers to uptake and adherence to ART, and recently, a syndemic framework has been applied to the role of multiple psychosocial syndemic factors and adherence to ART, in the USA. However, to our knowledge, these associations have not been investigated outside of the USA, nor in a multi-country context. To address these gaps, we assessed the association between multiple co-occurring psychosocial factors and engagement in HIV-related medical care and adherence to ART among a large, multinational sample of sexually-active HIV-infected men who have sex with men in Latin America. Among the 2020 respondents, 80.7% reported currently receiving HIV-related medical care, 72.3% reported currently receiving ART; among those, 62.5% reported 100% adherence. Compared with experiencing no psychosocial health problems, experiencing five or more psychosocial health problems is associated with 42% lower odds of currently receiving HIV-related medical care (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.36, 0.95) and of currently receiving ART (aOR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.38, 0.91). The number of psychosocial health problems experienced was associated with self-reported ART adherence in a dose-response relationship; compared to those with none of the factors, individuals with one syndemic factor had 23% lower odds (aOR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.60, 0.97) and individuals with five or more syndemic factors had 72% lower odds (aOR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.14, 0.55) of reporting being 100% adherent to ART. Addressing co-occurring psychosocial problems as potential barriers to uptake and adherence of ART in Latin America may improve the effectiveness of secondary prevention interventions.

T1  - HIV's Syndemic Links With Mental Health, Substance Use, and Violence in an Environment of Stigma and Disparities in Japan.
A1  - DiStefano, Anthony S
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - A syndemics orientation has become a valuable lens through which to understand the complex system dynamics of HIV, HIV's links to other social and health problems, and the design of effective, comprehensive interventions. Using data from a broader ethnographic study of HIV epidemics in the Kansai Region and Tokyo Metropolitan Area of Japan, I found that HIV was synergistically linked with poor mental health, substance use, and violence, suggesting the existence of at least three syndemics. These occurred in an environment of stigma and social and health disparities, particularly for men who have sex with men, transgender persons, immigrants, and people living with HIV. Integrated interventions, led by Japan's HIV nongovernmental organizations and supported by the government, should more aggressively target stigma, which underlies most of the syndemic connections. Quantitative research should build upon the ethnographically derived associations shown here and test whether there are additive syndemic effects. Copyright © The Author(s) 2016.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Historically, HIV studies have conflated men who have sex with men (MSM) with transgender (trans) women, explicitly excluded trans individuals, or included sample sizes of trans people that are too small to reach meaningful conclusions. Despite the heavy burden of HIV among trans women, conflation of this population with MSM has limited the information available on the social and behavioural factors that increase HIV vulnerability among trans women and how these factors may differ from MSM. Using data sets from quantitative studies among MSM (n = 645) and trans women (n = 89), as well as qualitative in-depth interviews with 30 trans women in Baltimore, we explore what these data tell us about similarities and differences in HIV vulnerability between the two groups and where they leave gaps in our understanding. We conclude with implications for data collection and intervention development.

T1  - Acculturative Stress and Risky Sexual Behavior: The Roles of Sexual Compulsivity and Negative Affect.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Recent syndemic models of sexual health disparities affecting racial/ethnic minorities have highlighted the role of discrimination. Yet no previous work has examined how acculturative stress (distress at the transition from one's original culture toward a new culture) associates with sexual HIV-risk behavior (SHRB). Work among other minority populations suggests sexual compulsivity (SC) may contribute to syndemic sexual health disparities as a means of coping with distress. With this in mind, the present study examined whether SC explained the relation between acculturative stress and SHRB. Separate analyses were conducted for males and females within a sample of 758 sexually initiated racial/ethnic minority college students. Among males and females, acculturative stress had an indirect effect on SHRB via SC. As the first study to examine SHRB in relation to acculturative stress, findings provide preliminary evidence that targeting SC among racial/ethnic minorities may help reduce sexual health disparities.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - The purpose of the current study was to examine whether syndemic stress in partnered gay men might undermine communication processes essential to the utilization of negotiated safety and other harm reduction strategies that rely on partners' HIV status disclosure. Participants included 100 gay male couples (N = 200 individuals) living in the U.S., who responded to an online survey. Participants completed measures of five syndemic factors (depression, poly-drug use, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and sexual compulsivity). They also reported on whether condoms were used during first intercourse together and the timing of first condomless anal intercourse (CAI) relative to HIV disclosure in their relationship. Results of binary logistic regression analyses supported the hypothesis that the sum of partners' syndemic stress was negatively associated with condom use at first intercourse and with HIV disclosure prior to first CAI. Syndemic stress may contribute to HIV transmission risk between main partners in part because it accelerates the progression to CAI and interferes with communication processes central to harm reduction strategies utilized by gay men in relationships. Implications for prevention strategies and couples interventions, such as couples HIV counseling and testing, that facilitate communication skill-building, are discussed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We intended to verify the syndemic effect of psychosocial health conditions on suicidal ideation among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Shanghai, China; design a comprehensive framework for the identification of the MSM with suicidal ideation; and provide suggestion for suicidality intervention among MSM., METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 547 MSM in 4 districts in Shanghai. Sociodemographic, psychosocial, and suicidal ideation information of the participants was collected. Logistic regressions were performed to assess the relationship between psychosocial variables and suicidal ideation and to verify the syndemic effect of psychosocial factors., RESULTS: Of the MSM sample, 10.6% reported suicidal thoughts in the past year. In univariate analysis, depression, anxiety, loneliness, impulsivity, involuntary subordination (IS), social support, and risky sex were associated with suicidal ideation. Multivariate analysis found that IS (ORm = 2.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.55-5.51) and risky sex (ORm = 3.79, 95% CI = 1.44-9.97) remained significant. The MSM with more than 5 psychosocial health problems were nearly 4 times more likely (adjusted odds ratio = 4.68, 95% CI = 2.23-9.80) to have had suicidal ideation in the past year., CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the syndemic effect of psychosocial health problems in magnifying the risk of suicidality among MSM. More integrated and holistic approaches in the identification of high-risk groups and intervention of suicidality among MSM are needed. Copyright (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - Female-to-male trans masculine adults who have sex with cisgender (non-transgender) males (TMSM) represent an understudied population in relation to HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk. This study examined the role of syndemic conditions and social gender affirmation processes (living full-time in one's identified gender) in potentiating sexual risk among TMSM adults in Massachusetts, US. Cross-sectional data were restricted to TMSM who reported lifetime sexual behaviour with a cisgender male (n = 173; mean age = 29.4, SD = 9.6; 18.5% people of colour; 93.1% non-heterosexual identity; 56.1% hormones/surgery). Sexual risk outcomes were: lifetime STI diagnoses, three or more sexual partners in the previous six months, and condomless anal/vaginal sex at last encounter with a cisgender male. Age- and survey mode-adjusted logistic regression models regressed sexual risk outcomes on the main effect of syndemics (six indicators summed: binge drinking, substance use, depression, anxiety, childhood abuse, intimate partner violence), followed by the interaction of syndemics and social gender affirmation. Syndemics were associated with increased odds of all sexual risk indicators (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] = 1.32-1.55; p < 0.0001). Social gender affirmation moderated the association between syndemics and condomless anal/vaginal sex at last encounter with a cisgender male (p < 0.0001). Syndemics were associated with sexual risk in TMSM who had socially affirmed their gender (aOR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.42-2.25; p < 0.001), but not among those TMSM who had not (aOR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.63-1.19; p = 0.37). Findings suggest that syndemic pathways to sexual risk are similar for TMSM who have socially gender affirmed as for cisgender MSM. Integration of syndemics and gender affirmation frameworks is recommended in interventions to address TMSM sexual risk. Copyright © The Author(s) 2016.

N2  - Multiple psychosocial conditions tend to co-occur and contribute to higher risk for HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM), a phenomenon known as syndemics. Less is known about moderating factors that may attenuate the relation between syndemic conditions and sexual risk-taking. We examined disclosure of same-sex sexual behavior or "outness" as a moderating factor of the syndemic effect. We recruited a sample of MSM (n = 191) using respondent-driven sampling in Tijuana, Mexico. Participants completed a survey of syndemic conditions (i.e., substance use, depression, violence, internalized homophobia, and sexual compulsivity), sexual risk-taking (i.e., condom unprotected anal sex with a stranger in the past 2 months), and the degree to which they are "out" about sex with men. Consistent with previous research, we found that men who report more syndemic conditions show a greater prevalence of sexual risk-taking. As predicted, men who were out to more people showed a weaker association between syndemic conditions and sexual risk-taking, whereas men who were out to fewer people showed the strongest association. This study is the first to provide evidence of "outness" as a moderating factor that attenuates syndemic effects on sexual risk-taking. Building upon previous research, the data suggest that "outness" may be a resilience factor for MSM in Tijuana. HIV prevention intervention implications are discussed.

T1  - Religion and Spirituality's Influences on HIV Syndemics Among MSM: A Systematic Review and Conceptual Model.
A1  - Lassiter, Jonathan M
A1  - Parsons, Jeffrey T
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - This paper presents a systematic review of the quantitative HIV research that assessed the relationships between religion, spirituality, HIV syndemics, and individual HIV syndemics-related health conditions (e.g. depression, substance abuse, HIV risk) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. No quantitative studies were found that assessed the relationships between HIV syndemics, religion, and spirituality. Nine studies, with 13 statistical analyses, were found that examined the relationships between individual HIV syndemics-related health conditions, religion, and spirituality. Among the 13 analyses, religion and spirituality were found to have mixed relationships with HIV syndemics-related health conditions (6 nonsignificant associations; 5 negative associations; 2 positive associations). Given the overall lack of inclusion of religion and spirituality in HIV syndemics research, a conceptual model that hypothesizes the potential interactions of religion and spirituality with HIV syndemics-related health conditions is presented. The implications of the model for MSM's health are outlined.

N2  - Young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at increased likelihood of experiencing depression and engaging in condomless sexual behaviors. The goal of the current investigation was to examine the relationship between negative mood and compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) and to assess for their individual and combined influence on sexual risk-taking behavior among a diverse sample of YMSM in New York City (the P18 Cohort Study). We first analyzed sociodemographic, depressive symptoms, CSB, and sexual risk-taking from the cross-sectional data of 509, 18- or 19-year-old YMSM recruited using non-probability sampling. We found a significant positive correlation between CSB and depression and between CSB and frequency of condomless anal sex acts reported over the last 30 days. Multivariate results found that the presence of both depression and CSB contributed to elevated sexual risk-taking among these urban YMSM. Clinical implications include the importance of assessing for CSB when depression is present and vice versa in order to improve HIV prevention. Informed by minority stress theory and syndemic theory, our results suggest that interventions focused on the health of YMSM recognize that mental health and social context all interact to increase physical health vulnerability vis-a-vis sexual behaviors, depression, and CSB. Thus, HIV prevention and intervention programs need to incorporate mental health components and services that address these needs.

N2  - A paucity of information regarding mental health exists for patients presenting for HIV non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP). We reviewed electronic medical records of 894 adult nPEP patients seen at a large Boston community health center between 1997 and 2013. Of 821 patients with consensual sexual exposures, 88.3 % were men who have sex with men, and 40.0 % had a mental health diagnosis. Diagnoses included: depression (24.4 %), anxiety (21.9 %), attention deficit disorder (7.8 %), post-traumatic stress disorder (3.3 %), and psychotic disorders (3.3 %). Of 129 patients with substance use disorders, alcohol dependence (65.9 %) and crystal methamphetamine (43.4 %) predominated. Unprotected receptive anal intercourse was associated with psychotic disorders (aOR = 4.86; 95 %CI:1.76-13.5) and substance use disorders (aOR = 1.89; 95 %CI:1.28-2.80). Substance use at the time of exposure was associated with: depression (aOR = 1.95; 95 %CI:1.36-2.80), anxiety (aOR = 2.22; 95 %CI:1.51-3.25), attention deficit disorder (aOR = 1.96; 95 %CI:1.18-3.27), and substance use disorder (aOR = 4.78; 95 %CI:3.30-6.93). Mental illness should be screened for and addressed at nPEP visits to optimize HIV risk-reduction.

N2  - The theory of syndemics has been used to explain elevated HIV risk facing men who have sex with men (MSM). However, few studies have employed suitable analytical methods to test this theory. Using data from a probability-based sample of MSM in India, we tested three proposed models linking the co-occurring epidemics of violence victimisation, drug use, and frequent alcohol use to HIV risk: 1) the syndemic model of synergistically interacting epidemics; 2) the "chains of risk" model; and 3) the model of mutually causal epidemics. The primary outcome was inconsistent condom use with male or hijra (transgender women) partners in the past month. For the syndemic model, we included product terms between the exposures and assessed for interaction on the additive (linear probability regression) and multiplicative (logistic regression) scales. Path analysis was used to test the models of serially causal epidemics and mutually causal epidemics. Among 22,297 HIV-negative MSM, violence victimisation (24.7%), frequent alcohol use (27.5%), and drug use (10.9%) frequently co-occurred. We found evidence for a three-way interaction between violence victimisation, drug use and frequent alcohol use on both the multiplicative (semi-elasticity = 0.28; 95% CI 0.10, 0.47) and additive (b = 0.14; 95% CI 0.01, .27) scales. We also estimated statistically significant two-way interactions between violence victimisation and frequent alcohol use on the multiplicative (semi-elasticity = .10; 95% CI 0.008, 0.20) and additive (b = 0.05, 95% CI 0.002, 0.107) scales, and between drug use and frequent alcohol use on the multiplicative (semi-elasticity = 0.13, 95% CI 0.02, 0.24) and additive (b = 0.06, 95% CI 0.007, 0.129) scales. Thus, we found strong evidence for the syndemic model. The models of serially causal and mutually causal epidemics were partially supported. These findings highlight the need to sharpen how syndemic models are specified so that their empirical predictions can be adequately tested and distinguished from other theories of disease distribution.

N2  - Using syndemics theory as a framework, we explored the experience of men who have sex with men in India in relation to four syndemic conditions (depression, alcohol use, internalised homonegativity and violence victimisation) and to understand their resilience resources. Five focus groups were conducted among a purposive sample of diverse men along with seven key informant interviews with HIV service providers. Participants ' narratives suggested various pathways by which syndemic conditions interact with one another to sequentially or concurrently increase HIV risk. Experiences of discrimination and violence from a range of perpetrators (family, ruffians and police) contributed to internalised homonegativity and/or depression, which in turn led some men to use alcohol as a coping strategy. Stigma related to same-sex sexuality, gender non-conformity and sex work contributed to the production of one or more syndemic conditions. While rejection by family and male regular partners contributed to depression/alcohol use, support from family, regular partners and peers served as resources of resilience. In India, HIV prevention and health promotion efforts among men who have sex with men could be strengthened by multi-level multi-component interventions to reduce intersectional/intersecting stigma, address syndemic conditions and foster resilience - especially by promoting family acceptance and peer support.

N2  - Background: Limited data are available on HBV, HCV, and HIV co-infections and triple infection. We characterized co-occurrence of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections at the population level in British Columbia (BC) to identify patterns of predisposing factors unique to co-infection subgroups., Methods: We analyzed data from the BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort, which includes all individuals tested for HCV or HIV in BC between 1992 and 2013, or included in provincial public health registries of HIV, HCV, HBV, and active tuberculosis. Individuals were classified as negative, mono-, and co-infection groups based on HIV, HBV, and HCV status. We evaluated associations between risk factors (injection drug use, sexual orientation etc.) and co-infection groups using multivariate multinomial logistic regression., Findings: Of a total of 1,376,989 individuals included in the analysis, 1,276,290 were negative and 100,699 were positive for HIV, HBV, and/or HCV. Most cases (91,399, 90.8%) were mono-infected, while 3991 (4.0%) had HBV/HCV, 670 HBV/HIV (0.7%), 3459 HCV/HIV (3.4%), and 1180 HBV/HCV/HIV (1.2%) co-infection. Risk factor and demographic distribution varied across co-infection categories. MSM classification was associated with higher odds of all HIV co-infection groups, particularly HBV/HIV (OR 6.8; 95% CI: 5.6, 8.27), while injection drug use was most strongly associated with triple infection (OR 64.19; 95% CI: 55.11, 74.77) and HIV/HCV (OR 23.23; 95% CI: 21.32, 25.31)., Interpretation: Syndemics of substance use, sexual practices, mental illness, socioeconomic marginalization, and co-infections differ among population groups, highlighting avenues for optimal composition and context for health services to meet each population's unique needs., Funding: BC Centre for Disease Control and Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

N2  - Research on men who have sex with men (MSM) has uncovered psychosocial factors (syndemic indicators) that are associated additively with poor health. To test these relations in a sample of HIV-positive MSM, we enrolled 166 patients from two HIV clinics. We investigated relations between syndemic indicators and outcomes including medication nonadherence, condomless anal sex (CAS), and healthcare utilization. A large proportion of participants reported each syndemic indicator: polysubstance use 43%, suicide attempt 28%, childhood sexual abuse 39%, partner abuse 64%. Analyses confirmed an additive effect, whereby endorsing 1+ indicator was associated with increased odds of medication nonadherence and medical hospitalization.

N2  - Alcohol consumption is a significant public health concern among Latino men and Latina transgender women who have sex with men. However, characteristics and behaviors associated with alcohol consumption in this population, particularly in regard to the complex influence of syndemic factors, remain understudied. The purpose of this study was to examine predictors of high-risk alcohol consumption (i.e. binge or heavy drinking). Between January and March of 2014, 176 Latino men and Latina transgender women in New York City completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire. We developed a syndemics scale to reflect the total number of syndemic factors - clinically significant depression, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and discrimination - reported by each participant. We also carried out a multinomial logistic regression model predicting binge and heavy drinking. Forty-seven percent of participants reported high-risk alcohol consumption in the past 30 days (21% binge and 26% heavy). Approximately 16% of participants reported no syndemic factors, 27% reported one factor, 39% reported two factors, and 18% reported three or four. In the multinomial logistic regression model, our syndemic factors scale was not significantly associated with binge drinking. However, participants who reported three or four factors were significantly more likely to report heavy drinking. In addition, having multiple sexual partners was associated with an increased risk of binge and heavy drinking; involvement in a same-sex relationship was associated with binge drinking. Further work is needed to develop effective prevention intervention approaches for high-risk alcohol consumption within this population.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - PURPOSE: Race and HIV are intertwined in complex ways. African Americans, particularly those residing in the southern United States, are at great risk for contracting and subsequently transmitting HIV. Research on the extent to which members of this population understand the risks associated with engaging in specific behaviors is limited. This paper examines HIV knowledge among at-risk adult African American men and women and the factors associated with levels of HIV knowledge., METHODS: Based on a conceptual model derived from Social Disorganization Theory and Syndemics Theory, interviews were conducted between 2009 and 2011. Questionnaire-based interviews were conducted with 1,864 respondents from 80 strategically-chosen census block groups in Atlanta, Georgia. An innovative approach to assessing amount of HIV knowledge was implemented, to derive better estimates of the extent of knowledge., RESULTS: Overall, HIV knowledge was low (average=43.5% correct answers). Seven factors were identified as contributing uniquely to having higher levels of knowledge about HIV transmission: (1) younger age, (2) being educated beyond the high school level, (3) being gay, lesbian or bisexual, (4) experiencing sexual abuse during childhood and/or adolescence, (5) drinking alcohol less frequently, (6) knowing a larger number of HIV-infected persons and (7) knowing anyone currently living with "full blown" AIDS., CONCLUSION: HIV educational and intervention programs targeting at-risk African American adults need to develop effective ways of bolstering a solid understanding of how HIV is/not transmitted. In particular, efforts need to be targeted toward older adults, those with lower levels of educational attainment and persons who are not acquainted with anyone who is HIV-infected.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Purpose. This study examines the prevalence of alcohol-related problems, the factors underlying these problems, and whether or not there is evidence of syndemic effects in a community population of southern, urban African American women. Methods. Questionnaire-based interviews were conducted with 817 women, all African American, from 80 targeted census block groups in Atlanta, Georgia. Results. Most of the alcohol users (67.8%) experienced at least one problem as a result of their alcohol (ab)use, with most women experiencing two or more such problems. Eight factors were found to be associated with experiencing more alcohol problems: being aged 30 or older, having had no recent health insurance, lower levels of educational attainment, self-identifying as lesbian or bisexual, experiencing greater amounts of childhood maltreatment, greater impulsivity, perceiving one's local community or neighborhood to be unsafe, and having a larger number of criminally involved friends. Conclusions. Drinking-related problems were prevalent in this population. Numerous factors underlie the extent to which African American women experienced problems resulting from their alcohol use. There is strong evidence of syndemic-type effects influencing drinking problems in this population, and future efforts to reduce the negative impact of alcohol (ab)use ought to consider the adoption of programs using a syndemics' theory approach.

T1  - The syndemic of AIDS and STDS among MSM.
A1  - O'Leary, Dale
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The spread of HIV and other STDs among men who have sex with men (MSM) has been labeled a syndemic because in this population a number of different and interrelated health problems have come together and interact with one another. The various elements of the syndemic have an additive effect, each one intensifying the others. These factors include the number of infectious diseases endemic in this population, the high rate of substance abuse problems and psychological disorders, and the significant percentage of MSM who have experienced childhood sexual abuse and other adverse events. While MSM are disproportionately affected by HIV, syphilis, and other STDs, health activists from the gay community have systematically resisted the application of the full range of public health strategies traditionally used to prevent their spread. In the more than three decades since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, there have been substantial advances in testing and treatment, yet the infection rate among MSM, and particularly young MSM, remains high, even as it has been dropping among other risk groups. This paper deals with the history of the syndemic, the failure of various risk reduction strategies, and treatment as prevention.

T1  - Childhood Maltreatment and HIV Risk-Taking among Men Using the Internet Specifically to Find Partners for Unprotected Sex.
A1  - Klein, Hugh
A1  - Tilley, David
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Purpose: Using a Syndemics Theory conceptual model, this study examines the relationship between childhood maltreatment experiences and involvement in HIV risk taking in a sample of adult men who actively seek partners for unprotected sex via the Internet. One of the main advantages to using this theoretical model is that it considers the co-varying influences of factors such as childhood maltreatment, psychological/psychosocial functioning, risk-related preferences, demographic characteristics, substance use/abuse, and attitudes toward risk taking on actual risk practices., Methods: The study was based on a national random sample of 332 MSM who use the Internet to seek men with whom they can engage in unprotected sex. Data collection was conducted via telephone interviews between January 2008 and May 2009. Structural equation analysis was undertaken to examine the specific nature of the relationships involved in understanding HIV risk practices., Results: Childhood maltreatment experiences were not found to be related directly to involvement in HIV risk taking in adulthood. Childhood maltreatment, particularly in the form of emotional neglect, was found to be an important variable in the overall structural equation. Its effect on HIV risk taking was indirect, operating principally by having a negative impact upon self-esteem, which in turn had a negative effect on attitudes toward condom use, which in turn were related strongly and directly to risk taking., Conclusions: Childhood maltreatment experiences are relevant to understanding HIV risk practices among MSM in adulthood, but the relationship is not as simple as usually conceptualized. Rather, childhood maltreatment appears to impact risk taking indirectly, through its effects on mental health functioning, which in turn affects risk-related attitudes.

A1  - Viet, Vu Duc
A1  - Hao, Bui Thi Minh
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background. While HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Vietnam has received increasing attention, most studies focus on HIV knowledge and established risk factors such as injection drug use. This paper proposes to address HIV risk among MSM from an integrated approach to preventive care that takes into account syndemic conditions such as substance use, mental health, and stigma, the latter of which prevents MSM from accessing health services. Method. Current studies related to MSM in Vietnam from 2000 onwards, gathered from peer-reviewed as well as non-peer-reviewed sources, were examined. Results . HIV and STI prevalence among MSM varied significantly by location, and yet HIV prevalence has increased significantly over the past few years. Most studies have focused on sexual risk behaviors, paying little attention to the broad spectrum of sexual health, including noninjecting drug use, heavy alcohol consumption, high rates of mental health distress and anxiety, and stigma. Conclusion . Future research and interventions targeting MSM in Vietnam should address their vulnerability to HIV from an integrated approach that pays attention to both sexual health and syndemic conditions.

N2  - PURPOSE: Syndemics, or the co-occurrence and interaction of health problems, have been examined extensively among young men who have sex with men, but their existence remain unexamined, to our knowledge, among sexual-minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, and bisexual) women. Thus, we investigated if syndemics were present among young sexual-minority women, and if sexual-orientation discrimination was an independent variable of syndemic production., METHODS: A total of 467 sexual-minority women between the ages of 18 and 24 completed a cross-sectional online survey regarding their substance use, mental health, sexual behaviors, height, weight, and experiences of discrimination. We used structural equation modeling to investigate the presence of syndemics and their relationship to sexual-orientation discrimination., RESULTS: Heavy episodic drinking, marijuana use, ecstasy use, hallucinogen use, depressive symptoms, multiple sexual partners, and history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) comprised syndemics in this population (chi-square=24.989, P=.201; comparative fit index [CFI]=0.946; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=0.023). Sexual-orientation discrimination is significantly and positively associated with the latent syndemic variable (unstandardized coefficient=0.095, P<.05), and this model fit the data well (chi-square=33.558, P=.059; CFI=0.914; RMSEA=0.029). The reverse causal model showed syndemics is not an independent variable of sexual-orientation discrimination (unstandardized coefficient=0.602, P>.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Syndemics appear to be present and associated with sexual-orientation discrimination among young sexual-minority women. Interventions aimed at reducing discrimination or increasing healthy coping may help reduce substance use, depressive symptoms, and sexual risk behaviors in this population.

N2  - Previous studies documenting sexual minority women's disproportionate risk for a range of medical, mental health, and substance use disorders have not provided a predictive framework for understanding their interrelations and outcomes. The present study aimed to address this gap by testing the syndemic effect of co-occurring psychosocial problems on 7-year health care costs and utilization among sexual minority women. The sample was comprised of sexual minority women (N = 341) who were seen at an urban LGBT-affirmative community health center. Medical and mental health care utilization and cost data were extracted from electronic medical records. Demographically adjusted regression models revealed that co-occurring psychosocial problems (i.e., childhood sexual abuse, partner violence, substance use, and mental health distress [history of suicide attempt]) were all strongly interrelated. The presence of these indicators had a syndemic (additive) effect on medical costs and utilization and mental health utilization over 7-year follow-up, but no effect on 7-year mental health costs. These results suggest that the presence and additive effect of these syndemic conditions may, in part, explain increased medical costs and utilization (and higher medical morbidity) among sexual minority women.

N2  - The HIV epidemic in Latin America is highly concentrated in men who have sex with men (MSM). In the United States, multiple co-occurring psychosocial conditions have been shown to act as intertwined epidemics to potentiate HIV transmission among MSM. To date, no study has examined the role of syndemics and condomless sex among MSM in Latin America. In 2012, an online survey was conducted among members of the largest social/sexual networking website for MSM in Latin America. Participants were asked about demographics, sexual behaviors, HIV/STI diagnoses, and psychosocial well-being, including depression, suicidal ideation, hazardous alcohol use, hard drug use during sex, history of childhood/adolescent sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and sexual compulsivity. Multivariable logistic generalized estimation equations were used to assess the relationship of syndemic factors and (1) engagement in higher risk condomless anal sex and (2) self-report of prior HIV diagnosis. Among 24,274 survey respondents, 74.6 % of the sample had at least one syndemic factor. In an additive model, syndemics were associated with increased odds of higher risk condomless anal sex, ranging from adjusted odds ratio of 1.31 (95 % CI 1.20, 1.43) for one syndemic factor to 4.06 (95 % CI 3.25, 5.09) for 6/7 syndemic factors. Similarly, syndemics were associated with increased odds of HIV infection (p < .0001). This study provides initial evidence that intertwined syndemics increase HIV risk behavior and HIV infection among MSM in Latin America. In the Latin American context, comprehensive HIV prevention interventions for MSM should be developed and tested that simultaneously address co-occurring psychosocial conditions and HIV risk.

T1  - Syndemics of psychosocial problems and HIV risk: A systematic review of empirical tests of the disease interaction concept.

N2  - In the theory of syndemics, diseases co-occur in particular temporal or geographical contexts due to harmful social conditions (disease concentration) and interact at the level of populations and individuals, with mutually enhancing deleterious consequences for health (disease interaction). This theory has widespread adherents in the field, but the extent to which there is empirical support for the concept of disease interaction remains unclear. In January 2015 we systematically searched 7 bibliographic databases and tracked citations to highly cited publications associated with the theory of syndemics. Of the 783 records, we ultimately included 34 published journal articles, 5 dissertations, and 1 conference abstract. Most studies were based on a cross-sectional design (32 [80%]), were conducted in the U.S. (32 [80%]), and focused on men who have sex with men (21 [53%]). The most frequently studied psychosocial problems were related to mental health (33 [83%]), substance abuse (36 [90%]), and violence (27 [68%]); while the most frequently studied outcome variables were HIV transmission risk behaviors (29 [73%]) or HIV infection (9 [23%]). To test the disease interaction concept, 11 (28%) studies used some variation of a product term, with less than half of these (5/11 [45%]) providing sufficient information to interpret interaction both on an additive and on a multiplicative scale. The most frequently used specification (31 [78%]) to test the disease interaction concept was the sum score corresponding to the total count of psychosocial problems. Although the count variable approach does not test hypotheses about interactions between psychosocial problems, these studies were much more likely than others (14/31 [45%] vs. 0/9 [0%]; chi2 = 6.25, P = 0.01) to incorporate language about "synergy" or "interaction" that was inconsistent with the statistical models used. Therefore, more evidence is needed to assess the extent to which diseases interact, either at the level of populations or individuals, to amplify HIV risk. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Substance use is prevalent among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and may be associated with intimate partner violence (IPV). Experiences of IPV are associated with several adverse health conditions among adult MSM, but there is a gap in knowledge about this relationship among YMSM, which warrants further investigation., METHODS: This study employs baseline data from a prospective cohort study to examine lifetime experiences of IPV in relation to substance use in the previous 30 days among n=528 YMSM in New York City from 2009 to 2011. To examine the extent to which IPV (any experiences, victimization, and perpetration) are related to substance use (alcohol, marijuana, stimulant, and other drugs) in the last 30 days, distinct 2-step multinomial logistic regression models, controlling for sociodemographic differences, were constructed., RESULTS: 44.3% reported lifetime IPV experience, with 39.2% of reporting victimization and 30.5% reporting perpetration. IPV is associated with a 1.6 increased odds of 2 or more instances of alcohol use, a 1.6-1.8 increased odds of 2 or more instances of marijuana use, a 1.8-2.5 increased odds of 2 or more instances of stimulant use, and a 4.1-6.1 increased odds of 2 or more instances of other substance use., CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the strong association between IPV and increased frequency of substance use among YMSM and provide support that violence may exist as part of a syndemic facing YMSM. Prevention and intervention strategies may be improved by addressing substance use in the context of IPV and other related health challenges. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - A transdiagnostic minority stress treatment approach for gay and bisexual men's syndemic health conditions.
A1  - Pachankis, John E
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Developing and deploying separate treatments for separate conditions seems ill-suited to intervening upon the co-occurring, and possibly functionally similar, psychosocial conditions facing gay and bisexual men. This article argues for the need to create transdiagnostic interventions that reduce multiple syndemic conditions facing gay and bisexual men at the level of their shared source in minority stress pathways. This article first reviews psychosocial syndemic conditions affecting gay and bisexual men, then suggests pathways that might link minority stress to psychosocial syndemics based on recent advancements in emotion science, psychiatric nosology, and cognitive-affective neuroscience, and finally suggests cross-cutting psychosocial treatment principles to reduce minority stress-syndemic pathways among gay and bisexual men. Because minority stress serves as a common basis of all psychosocial syndemic conditions reviewed here, locating the pathways through which minority stress generates psychosocial syndemics and employing overarching treatment principles capable of simultaneously alleviating these pathways will ultimately create a transdiagnostic approach to improving gay and bisexual men's health. Clinical research and training approaches are suggested to further validate the pathways suggested here, establish the efficacy of treatment approaches tied to those pathways, and generate effective methods for disseminating a transdiagnostic minority stress treatment approach for gay and bisexual men's psychosocial syndemic health.

N2  - Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States. The epidemic is not evenly distributed across MSM, and young racial minority MSM experience the highest rate of new infections. Race-based sexual stereotyping is not uncommon among MSM, and it may contribute to the isolation of racial minority sexual networks, which has been found to contribute to increased HIV incidence in Black MSM. The goals of these analyses were to describe the race-based sexual preferences and stereotypes of racially diverse young MSM (YMSM), and to examine whether endorsement of sexual stereotypes was associated with sexual risk behavior when having sex with partners of the stereotyped race. Data were taken from Crew 450, an ongoing longitudinal study of a syndemic of psychosocial health issues linked to HIV among YMSM in Chicago and surrounding areas. Analyses utilized data from three study waves, and longitudinal analyses were conducted with Hierarchical Linear Modeling. YMSM generally endorsed same-race preferences for sexual partners. Black partners were rated highest in displaying stereotypically dominant characteristics and in likelihood of taking the top/insertive sex role, while Latino partners were rated the highest in likelihood of sex being hot and passionate. White partners were rated lowest on each of these domains. Longitudinal analyses found that endorsement of these stereotypes had important implications for the rate of condomless receptive and insertive anal sex with racial minority partners. Findings suggest that sexual stereotypes may contribute to the isolation of racial minority sexual networks.

N2  - Gay and bisexual men (GBM) continue to have a disproportionately higher HIV incidence than any other group in Canada and the United States. This study examined how multiple co-occurring psychosocial problems, also known as a syndemic, contribute to high-risk sexual behavior among GBM. It also examined the impact of early life adversity on high-risk sexual behavior as mediated by syndemic severity. A sample of 239 GBM completed self-report questionnaires at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Syndemic variables included depression, polysubstance use, and intimate partner violence. Early life adversity variables measured retrospectively included physical and verbal bullying by peers and physical and sexual abuse by adults. A Cochran-Armitage trend test revealed a proportionate increase between number of syndemic problems and engagement in high-risk sex (p < .0001), thereby supporting syndemic theory. All early life adversity variables were positively correlated with number of syndemic problems. A bootstrap mediation analysis revealed indirect effects of two types of early life adversity on high-risk sex via syndemic severity: verbal bullying by peers and physical abuse by adults. There was also an overall effect of physical bullying by peers on high-risk sexual behavior, but no specific direct or indirect effects were observed. Consistent with syndemic theory, results provide evidence that certain types of early life adversity impact high-risk sex later in life via syndemic problems. Behavioral interventions to reduce sexual risk among GBM should address anti-gay discrimination experienced before adulthood as well as adult psychological problems.

N2  - Among gay and bisexual men (GBM), a syndemic describes a situation in which negative conditions (e.g., childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, depression, polysubstance use) co-occur such to amplify HIV risk. Research has suggested that sexual compulsivity (SC) may also be a syndemic condition. Between 2011 and 2013, 368 highly sexually active (9+ male partners in 90 days) GBM completed a survey of syndemic factors as well as measures of sexual compulsivity (Sexual Compulsivity Scale [SCS]) and hypersexuality (hypersexual disorder screening inventory [HDSI]). Based on scores on the SCS and HDSI, participants were organized into three groups-negative on both ("Neither SC nor HD"); positive on the SCS only ("SC Only"), and positive on both the SCS and the HDSI ("Both SC and HD"). We found support for the utility of a three-group classification of sexual compulsivity/hypersexuality as one of the syndemic factors that contribute to HIV risk. The average number of syndemic factors experienced was lowest among those who experienced Neither SC nor HD and highest among the group that experienced Both SC and HD, with those experiencing SC Only falling between the two other groups. This study provided further evidence that sexual compulsivity/hypersexuality is a contributing factor to the syndemics model of HIV risk for GBM and that considering three levels of severity (i.e., SC along with HD) led to stronger model predictions than considering SC alone. SC/HD severity provides another modifiable target for HIV prevention intervention development.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - African American/Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the U.S. experience health and social disparities at greater rates than MSM of other races/ethnicities, including HIV infection and substance use. This mixed methods paper presents: 1) a quantitative examination of health and social disparities among a sample of substance-using African American/Black MSM (N=108), compared to Caucasian/White MSM (N=250), and 2) in-depth qualitative data from a subsample of African American/Black MSM (N=21) in order to contextualize the quantitative data. Findings indicate that compared to Caucasian/White MSM, African American/Black MSM experienced a wide range of health and social disparities including: substance use and dependence; buying, trading or selling sex; educational attainment; employment; homelessness; identifying as gay; HIV status; arrest history; social support; and satisfaction with one's living situation. Qualitative data suggests that structural interventions that address homophobia and the social environment would be likely to mitigate many of the health and social disparities experienced by African American/Black MSM.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine associations between intertwining epidemics (syndemics) and HIV medication adherence and viral load levels among HIV-positive MSM and to test whether adherence mediates the relationship between syndemics and viral load., DESIGN: We analysed participant data collected between 2003 and 2009 from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, a prospective HIV/AIDS cohort study in four U.S. cities., METHODS: We conducted longitudinal analyses (repeated measures mixed models) to assess whether differences in viral load levels, undetectable viral load and self-reported HIV medication adherence were associated with count of syndemic conditions (substance use, depression symptoms and sexual risk behaviour, range 0-3), adjusting for race/ethnicity, age and income. Mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modelling and the SAS %mediate macro., RESULTS: Syndemics count was associated with higher viral loads (P < 0.0001) and lower adherence (P < 0.0001). Increased counts of concomitant syndemics were associated with viral load (P < 0.01), detectable viral load (P < 0.05) and adherence (P < 0.001). Black MSM experienced worse outcomes across domains than white MSM (P < 0.0001) and experienced higher overall rates of syndemics (P < 0.01). Adherence significantly mediated the relationship between syndemics and viral load, accounting for an estimated 32.3% of the effect (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Effectively lowering viral load levels among MSM has implications for both HIV/AIDS prevention and care. Our findings suggest that integrating substance use interventions, mental healthcare and sexual risk prevention into standard HIV care may be necessary to optimize treatment and Treatment as Prevention (TasP) models.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We surveyed men who have sex with men (MSM) to determine whether sexual risk behaviors, recent drug use, and other psychosocial problems differed between men who engaged in one-on-one and group sexual encounters., METHODS: We conducted an Internet-based cross-sectional survey of 7158 MSM aged 18 years or older in the United States recruited from a gay-oriented sexual networking Web site in 2008. Among MSM who engaged in group sexual encounters, we compared their past-60-day sexual behaviors in one-on-one encounters and group sexual encounters. We also compared risk profiles and syndemic production between men who did and did not participate in group sex., RESULTS: Men reporting a group-sex encounter had significantly higher polydrug use and sexual risk than did the men not reporting group sex in the past 60 days. The odds of engaging in group sex with 4 or more sexual partners significantly increased with the number of psychosocial problems, supporting evidence of syndemic production., CONCLUSIONS: We identified a particularly high-risk subgroup in the MSM population with considerable psychosocial problems that may be reached online. Research is needed on how to engage these high-risk men in combination prevention interventions.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: We described trends for sexually transmitted infections (STI) among gay/bisexual men in British Columbia, Canada, using a sentinel site surveillance approach., METHODS: Using data from an electronic charting system, we included gay/bisexual men who visited high-volume STI clinics from 2000 to 2013. Diagnosis rates and incidence density were calculated for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis C, genital herpes, and genital warts. Incidence density was estimated among repeat testers who converted from a negative to positive test result. We also conducted Poisson regression analysis to determine factors that were associated with increased incidence rates., RESULTS: A total of 47,170 visits were identified for gay/bisexual men during our time frame. The median age was 34 years (interquartile range, 27-43 years), and most clients were seen in Vancouver. Although trends for most STI were stable, diagnoses of gonorrhea and syphilis have risen steadily in recent years. Coinfection with HIV was associated with higher gonorrhea and syphilis rates in the Poisson regression model. In addition, visiting a Vancouver clinic and younger age were associated with increased incidence., CONCLUSIONS: Our clinic-based sentinel surveillance system found increasing trends for gonorrhea and syphilis among gay/bisexual men but not for other STI in British Columbia. Further investigation is required to explore the syndemic effects of syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIV. This new platform will be a valuable tool for ongoing monitoring of STI and targeting prevention efforts.

N2  - HIV and intimate partner violence (IPV) epidemics propagate and interact in a syndemic fashion contributing to excess burden of disease and poorer health outcomes. In order to understand the impact of IPV on HIV disease management, a universal screening program was implemented in the Southern Alberta Clinic in May 2009. We evaluated our IPV screening protocol and made recommendations for its usage in HIV care. IPV data obtained from patients were evaluated, supplemented with responses from a subset of in-depth interviews. 35% of 1721 patients reported experiencing IPV. Prevalence was higher among females (46%), Aboriginal Canadians (67%), bisexual male/females (48%), and gay males (35%). Of 158 patients interviewed, only 22% had previously been asked about IPV in any health care setting. Patients were responsive to routine IPV screening emphasizing that referral services need to be easily accessible. 23% of patients disclosing IPV subsequently connected to additional IPV resources after screening. We recommend that universal IPV screening be incorporated within regular HIV clinic care. The IPV survey should be given after trust has been established with regular follow-up every 6-12 months. A referral process to local agencies dealing with IPV must be in place for patients disclosing abuses.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Mounting evidence suggests a syndemic relation between methamphetamine use and depression to increase sexual risk taking (i.e., HIV transmission risk behavior) among men who have sex with men. This prospective analysis of longitudinal data collected from an outpatient methamphetamine abuse treatment program for gay and bisexual men assessed whether symptoms of depression mediated and/or moderated the associations between methamphetamine use and unprotected insertive/receptive anal intercourse., METHOD: From November 2005 through October 2007, 167 treatment-seeking gay and bisexual men (63% HIV-positive) enrolled in and attended a 16-week methamphetamine abuse outpatient treatment program. Participants ' depressive symptoms, biomarker-confirmed methamphetamine use, and self-reported sexual risk taking were assessed at baseline and follow-up evaluations. Path analysis tested the mediating and moderating effects of depression on the associations between methamphetamine use and unprotected insertive/receptive anal intercourse., RESULTS: Methamphetamine use during the treatment period had a significant indirect (Coef. = -.15; 95% CI [-.23, -.06]), but no direct (Coef. = .11; ns) or total effect (Coef. = -.04; ns) on participants' sexual risk taking after accounting for the significant mediating (Coef. = .56; 95% CI [.33, .78]) and moderating (Coef. = -.03; 95% CI [-.04, -.02]) effects of depression., CONCLUSIONS: Depression fully mediated and weakly moderated associations between methamphetamine use and sexual risk taking in this sample. Interventions and treatment programs to reduce sexual risk taking among gay and bisexual men should simultaneously address methamphetamine use and depression to optimize health outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional studies have suggested that co-occurring epidemics or "syndemics" of psychosocial health problems may accelerate HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. We aimed to assess how 5 syndemic conditions (depressive symptoms, heavy alcohol use, stimulant use, polydrug use, and childhood sexual abuse) affected HIV incidence and sexual risk behavior over time., METHODS: Eligible men in a large prospective cohort of sexually active HIV-uninfected MSM completed HIV testing and behavioral surveys at baseline and every 6 months for 48 months. We examined interrelationships between psychosocial problems and whether these interactions increased the odds of HIV risk behaviors and risk of seroconversion over study follow-up., RESULTS: Among 4295 men, prevalence of psychosocial conditions was substantial at baseline and was positively associated with each other. We identified a statistically significant positive dose-response relationship between numbers of syndemic conditions and HIV seroconversion for all comparisons (with the greatest hazard among those with 4-5 conditions, adjusted hazard ratio = 8.69; 95% confidence interval: 4.78 to 15.44). The number of syndemic conditions also predicted increased HIV-related risk behaviors over time, which mediated the syndemic-HIV seroconversion association., CONCLUSIONS: The accumulation of syndemic psychosocial problems predicted HIV-related sexual risk behaviors and seroconversion in a large sample of US MSM. Given the high prevalence of syndemic conditions among MSM and the moderate effect sizes attained by traditional brief behavioral interventions to date, the HIV prevention agenda requires a shift toward improved assessment of psychosocial comorbidities and stronger integration with mental health and substance abuse treatment services.

N2  - The persistence of disparities in STI/HIV risk among a new generation of emerging adult gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YMSM) warrant holistic frameworks and new methodologies for investigating the behaviors related to STI/HIV in this group. In order to better understand the continued existence of these disparities in STI/HIV risk among YMSM, the present study evaluated the presence and persistence of syndemic conditions among YMSM by examining the co-occurrence of alcohol and drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden over time. Four waves of data, collected over the first 18 months of a 7 wave, 36-month prospective cohort study of YMSM (n=600) were used to examine the extent to which measurement models of drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden remained consistent across time using latent class modeling. Health challenges persisted across time as these YMSM emerged into young adulthood and the measurement models for the latent constructs of drug use and unprotected sexual behavior were essentially consistent across time whereas models for mental health burden varied over time. In addition to confirming the the robustness of our measurement models which capture a more holistic understandings of the health conditions of drug use, unprotected sex, and mental health burden, these findings underscore the ongoing health challenges YMSM face as they mature into young adulthood. These ongoing health challenges, which have been understood as forming a syndemic, persist over time, and add further evidence to support ongoing and vigilant comprehensive health programming for sexual minority men that move beyond a sole focus on HIV.

N2  - Compared with the extant research on heterosexual intimate partner violence (IPV)-including the knowledge base on alcohol and illicit drug use as predictors of such IPV-there is a paucity of studies on IPV among men who have sex with men (MSM), especially Black MSM. This study investigates the prevalence of experiencing and perpetrating IPV among a sample of Black MSM couples and examines whether heavy drinking and/or illicit substance use is associated with IPV. We conducted a secondary analysis on a data set from 74 individuals (constituting 37 Black MSM couples) screened for inclusion in a couple-based HIV prevention pilot study targeting methamphetamine-involved couples. More than one third (n= 28, 38%) reported IPV at some point with the current partner: 24 both experiencing and perpetrating, 2 experiencing only, and 2 perpetrating only. IPV in the past 30 days was reported by 21 (28%) of the participants: 18 both experiencing and perpetrating, 1 experiencing only, and 2 perpetrating only. Heavy drinking and methamphetamine use each was associated significantly with experiencing and perpetrating IPV throughout the relationship as well as in the past 30 days. Rock/crack cocaine use was significantly associated with any history of experiencing and perpetrating IPV. Altogether, IPV rates in this sample of Black MSM couples equal or exceed those observed among women victimized by male partners as well as the general population of MSM. This exploratory study points to a critical need for further efforts to understand and address IPV among Black MSM. Similar to heterosexual IPV, results point to alcohol and illicit drug use treatment as important avenues to improve the health and social well-being of Black MSM. Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.

N2  - BACKGROUND: 'Syndemic factors', defined as co-occurring psychological conditions including major depressive disorder, substance and alcohol use, and intimate partner violence, have been shown to increase HIV incidence among MSM in the United States. However, this relationship has not been well characterized in the general population, particularly in the context of poverty., DESIGN: Prospective cohort study including a nationally-representative sample of 34 427 men and women in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions wave 1 (2001-2002) and wave 2 (2004-2005)., METHODS: Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between syndemic factors and newly diagnosed HIV infection, and to assess how living below the poverty line (based on 2001 US Poverty Guidelines) modified this relationship., RESULTS: The proportion of participants reporting new HIV diagnosis in the past year was 0.22%, increasing from 0.19% among individuals with no syndemic factor to 5.1% among those with four syndemic factors. Adjusting for potentially confounding factors, each additional syndemic factor was associated with a 47% increase in odds of HIV infection [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-1.65]. The effect of syndemic factors was stronger among individuals living below federal poverty guidelines (aOR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) compared to those living above poverty guidelines (aOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.36)., CONCLUSIONS: Among the US general population, the association between co-occurring syndemic factors and incident HIV infection was stronger in the setting of poverty. Mental health interventions, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, should be considered to reduce transmission of HIV.

T1  - Most at-risk populations: contextualising HIV prevention programmes targeting marginalised groups in Zanzibar, Tanzania.
A1  - Ahmed, Naheed
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - According to a 2009 UNAIDS report the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in Zanzibar, Tanzania, is low in the general population (0.6%), but high among vulnerable groups, specifically sex workers (10.8%), injecting drug users (15.1%), and men who have sex with men (12.3%). In response to this concentrated epidemic, the Government of Zanzibar, international and local non-profit organisations have focused their prevention activities on these marginal populations. Although these efforts are beneficial in terms of disseminating information about HIV/AIDS and referring clients to health clinics, they fail to address how the socio-economic status of these groups places them at a greater risk for contracting and dying from the virus. Furthermore, there is an absence of qualitative research on these populations which is needed to understand the challenges these groups face and to improve the effectiveness of interventions. Through interviews with employees of government agencies and non-profit organisations, medical professionals, vulnerable populations and HIV/AIDS patients, this paper used a political economy of health and syndemic framework to examine how local realities inform and challenge HIV/AIDS programmes in Zanzibar.

N2  - Research shows that young men who have sex with men (YMSM) engage in higher rates of health risk behaviors and experience higher rates of negative health outcomes than their peers. The purpose of this study is to determine if the effects of adversity on HIV risk are mediated by syndemics (co-occurring health problems). Participants were 470 ethnically diverse YMSM ages 18 to 24 recruited between 2005 and 2006 and surveyed every 6 months for 24 months. Regression analyses examined the impact of adversity on syndemics (emotional distress, substance use, and problematic alcohol use) and the effects of both adversity and syndemics on HIV risk behaviors over time. Gay-related discrimination and victimization-among other adversity variables-were significantly associated with syndemics and condomless sex (CS). Syndemics mediated the effects of adversity on CS in all models. Adverse events impact HIV risk taking among YMSM through syndemics. These findings suggest that prevention programs aimed at reducing adversity may reduce both the synergistic effect of multiple psychosocial health problems and HIV risk taking.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Syndemics theory has been proposed as a framework for understanding the role of multiple risk factors driving the HIV epidemic among gay and bisexual men. Previous studies have examined five syndemic indicators (polydrug use, depression, childhood sexual abuse, sexual compulsivity, and intimate partner violence). Many of these studies have utilized sum scores, the total number of syndemic factors endorsed, to quantify syndemic stress. This approach assumes a unidimensional latent factor and equivalence of factor loadings. It also overlooks the possibility that patterns, or classes, of syndemic factor endorsement may be present. The current study utilized survey data from 669 gay and bisexual men to test assumptions of unidimensionality and factor loading equivalence and to examine the utility of identifying latent classes of syndemic stress. Analysis supported operationalizing syndemics as a unidimensional latent factor. Assumptions of loading equality were not supported. Meaningful profiles of syndemic stress were not evident in latent class analysis results.

N2  - Men who have sex with men (MSM) in Bangkok may experience multiple psychosocial health conditions, such as substance use, suicidality, and a history of sexual abuse. These factors may contribute to HIV vulnerability in a syndemic way. A syndemic is defined as a number of synergistically interacting health conditions producing excess disease in a population. The objective of this study is to examine whether psychosocial health conditions among MSM have a syndemic association with HIV prevalence and HIV incidence. To do this, we evaluated psychosocial health conditions and their associations with unprotected sex, HIV prevalence and HIV incidence in a cohort of Thai MSM (N = 1,292). There was a positive and significant association between the number of psychosocial health conditions and increased levels of unprotected sex and HIV prevalence at study baseline. The number of psychosocial health conditions at baseline was also associated with increased HIV incidence during follow-up (no conditions, HIV incidence = 15.3 %; one to three conditions, 23.7 %; four to five conditions, 33.2 %). The number of psychosocial health conditions was positively associated with HIV risk behavior and HIV prevalence and incidence. Prevention efforts among MSM need to address the existence of multiple psychosocial health conditions and their synergy to effectively decrease the spread of HIV infection.

N2  - We sought to characterize HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and psychosocial correlates of adherence in a sample of gay, bisexual, and other non-gay or -bisexual identified men who have sex with men aged 50 and over. As part of a cross-sectional study we recruited a community-based sample of 199 men and assessed adherence to current ART medications along four domains: (1) missing doses in the past 4 days, (2) taking doses on the specified schedule in the past 4 days, (3) following instructions about how to take the medications (e.g., to take medications with food), and (4) missing doses in the last weekend. A total adherence score was also computed. Bivariable analyses indicated negative associations between depression, sexual compulsivity, and HIV-related stigma with each of the individual adherence variables and the composite adherence score, while an older age was found to be protective. In multivariable analyses, controlling for age and educational attainment, a higher likelihood of missing doses and failing to follow instructions were related to higher levels of HIV-related stigma, while dosing off-schedule and missing doses on weekends was associated with higher levels of sexual compulsivity. These results indicate that psychosocial burdens undermine the adherence behaviors of older HIV-positive sexual minority men. Programming and services to address this compromising health behavior must embrace a holistic approach to health as informed by syndemics theory, while attending to the developmental and age-specific needs of older men.

N2  - The present study sought to replicate effects of the number of syndemic psychosocial health conditions on sexual risk behavior and HIV infection among a sample of high-risk African American men who have sex with men (MSM) and to identify resilience factors that may buffer these effects. We used baseline data from an HIV risk-reduction trial to examine whether a higher number of syndemic conditions was associated with higher rates of self-reported sexual risk behavior and HIV infection. Using logistic regression models, we tested for interactions between number of syndemic conditions and several potential resilience factors to identify buffering effects. Replicating previous studies, we found significant associations between numbers of syndemic conditions and higher rates of sexual risk behavior and HIV infection. Surprisingly, we also replicated a previous finding (Stall et al., Am J Public Health, 93(6):939-942, 2003) that the effects of syndemic burden on HIV status fell off at the highest levels of syndemic conditions. Among a variety of potential resilience factors, two-optimism and education-buffered the syndemic effect on HIV prevalence. This is, to our knowledge, the first paper to identify resilience factors buffering against syndemic effects among MSM. It also constitutes a significant contribution to the literature regarding prevention among black MSM. These results point to the need to identify HIV-positive black MSM and provide effective treatment for them and to develop interventions addressing both syndemic and resilience factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM), injection drug users (IDUs), and certain subgroups of heterosexuals are disproportionately affected by the syndemics of HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, and viral hepatitis. Although understanding the burden of these infections in these populations by urbanicity (the degree to which a geographic area is urban) is critical to targeting prevention programs, few studies have done so., METHODS: We analyzed nationally representative 1999 to 2010 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey on persons aged 18 to 59 years. We estimated the weighted prevalence of HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), human papillomavirus, chlamydia, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, stratified by urbanicity level, for the overall sample, MSM, IDUs, and heterosexuals. Geographic areas with population at least million are classified into large central and large fringe metropolitan counties., RESULTS: Overall, large central metropolitan areas had a higher prevalence of HIV, HSV-2, and hepatitis B. HIV prevalence among MSM was elevated in large central and large fringe metro areas (14.5% and 16.9%, respectively). Among heterosexuals, large central metropolitan areas had elevated prevalence of HSV-2, chlamydia, and hepatitis B. Human papillomavirus and hepatitis C prevalence did not vary significantly by urbanicity for any population, including IDUs., CONCLUSIONS: Infections with higher prevalence in urban areas merit a geographically focused approach to screening and prevention programs, whereas those with uniform prevalence across levels of urbanicity would benefit from a generalized prevention approach. These nationally representative, population-based data allow for more effective planning for prevention programs.

N2  - Young, African American and Latino gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately represented among new HIV cases according to the most recent national surveillance statistics. Analysts have noted that these racial/ethnic disparities in HIV among MSM exist within the wider context of sexual, mental and physical health disparities between MSM and heterosexuals. The intercorrelation of these adverse health outcomes among MSM, termed syndemics, has been theorized to be socially produced by a heterosexist social system that marginalizes lesbian, gay, bisexual, MSM and other sexual minorities. African American and Latino MSM experience overlapping systems of oppression that may increase their risk of experiencing syndemic health outcomes. In this paper, using data from twenty in-depth qualitative interviews with MSM living in four New York City (NYC) neighborhoods, we present accounts of neighborhood space, examining how space can both physically constitute and reinforce social systems of stratification and oppression, which in turn produce social disparities in sexual health outcomes. By analyzing accounts of emerging sexuality in neighborhood space, i.e. across time and space, we identify pathways to risk and contribute to our understanding of how neighborhood space is experienced by gay men, adding to our ability to support young men as they emerge in place and to shape the social topography of urban areas.

T1  - Early life emotional neglect and HIV risk taking among men using the Internet to find other men for unprotected sex.
A1  - Klein, Hugh
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - PURPOSE: Using a Syndemics Theory conceptual model, this study examines the relationship between emotional neglect experiences during childhood and/or adolescence and involvement in HIV risk taking in a sample of adult men who actively seek partners for unprotected sex via the Internet., METHODS: The study was based on a national random sample of 332 MSM who use the Internet to seek men with whom they can engage in unprotected sex. Data collection was conducted via telephone interviews between January 2008 and May 2009. Structural equation analysis was undertaken to examine the specific nature of the relationships involved in understanding HIV risk practices., RESULTS: Emotional neglect was highly prevalent among the men participating in this study. Emotional neglect experiences were not found to be related directly to involvement in HIV risk taking in adulthood. Emotional neglect, was found to be an important variable in the overall structural equation. Its effect on HIV risk taking was indirect, operating principally by having a negative impact upon self-esteem, which in turn had a negative effect on attitudes toward condom use, which in turn were related strongly and directly to risk taking., CONCLUSIONS: Childhood experiences with emotional neglect are relevant to understanding HIV risk practices among MSM in adulthood, but the relationship is not as simple as usually conceptualized. Rather, emotional neglect appears to impact risk taking indirectly, through its effects on mental health functioning, which in turn affects risk-related attitudes. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the relationship among syndemic conditions (defined as a cluster of interconnected psychosocial health conditions), sexual behaviours and self-reported HIV infection in a global sample of men who have sex with men (MSM)., METHODS: We used generalised estimating equations logistic regression models with robust SEs to assess the relationships among cumulative number of syndemic conditions--including depression, substance use, violence, sexual stigma and homelessness--and unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) and HIV infection, while accounting for clustering within-country in a global cross-sectional survey of 3934 MSM across 151 countries., RESULTS: We observed parallel, significant dose-response associations between the number of syndemic conditions and UAI, as well as number of syndemic conditions and HIV infection. Compared with participants without syndemics, the adjusted OR (aOR) for UAI among those with 1, 2 and 3 or more syndemic conditions were 1.44 (Bonferroni-adjusted 95% CI 1.23 to 1.68), 1.89 (1.51 to 2.36) and 2.03 (1.43 to 2.89), respectively. Compared with participants without syndemics, the aOR for HIV infection among those with 1, 2 and 3 or more syndemic conditions were 1.67 (1.24 to 2.26), 2.02 (1.44 to 2.85) and 2.35 (1.31 to 4.21), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides evidence of intertwining syndemics that may operate synergistically to increase HIV risk among MSM globally. To curb HIV effectively and advance the health of MSM, multiple conditions must be addressed concurrently using multi-level approaches that target both individual and structural risk factors.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of people coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV in San Francisco, the San Francisco Department of Public Health's Communicable Disease Control and Prevention Section and the HIV Epidemiology Section collaborated to link their registries., METHODS: In San Francisco, hepatitis reporting is primarily through passive laboratory-based surveillance, and HIV/AIDS reporting is primarily through laboratory-initiated active surveillance. We conducted the registry linkage in 2010 using a sequential algorithm., RESULTS: The registry match included 31,997 HBV-infected people who were reported starting in 1984; 10,121 HCV-infected people who were reported starting in 2001; and 34,551 HIV/AIDS cases reported beginning in 1981. Of the HBV and HCV cases, 6.3% and 12.6% were coinfected with HIV, respectively. The majority of cases were white males; however, black people were disproportionately affected. For more than 90% of the HBV/HIV cases, male-to-male sexual contact (men who have sex with men [MSM]) was the risk factor for HIV infection. Injection drug use was the most frequent risk factor for HIV infection among the HCV/HIV cases; however, 35.6% of the HCV/HIV coinfected males were MSM but not injection drug users., CONCLUSIONS: By linking the two registries, we found new ways to foster collaborative work and expand our programmatic flexibility. This analysis identified particular populations at risk for coinfection, which can be used by viral hepatitis and HIV screening, prevention, and treatment programs to integrate, enhance, target, and prioritize prevention services and clinical care within the community to maximize health outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We examined a syndemic of psychosocial health issues among young men who have sex with men (MSM), with men and women (MSMW), and with women (MSW). We examined hypothesized drivers of syndemic production and effects on suicide attempts., METHODS: Using a pooled data set of 2005 and 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 11 jurisdictions, we used structural equation modeling to model a latent syndemic factor of depression symptoms, substance use, risky sex, and intimate partner violence. Multigroup models examined relations between victimization and bullying experiences, syndemic health issues, and serious suicide attempts., RESULTS: We found experiences of victimization to increase syndemic burden among all male youths, especially MSMW and MSM compared with MSW (variance explained = 44%, 38%, and 10%, respectively). The syndemic factor was shown to increase the odds of reporting a serious suicide attempt, particularly for MSM (odds ratio [OR] = 5.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36, 24.39; P < .001) and MSMW (OR = 5.08; 95% CI = 2.14, 12.28; P < .001) compared with MSW (OR = 3.47; 95% CI = 2.50, 4.83; P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Interventions addressing multiple psychosocial health outcomes should be developed and tested to better meet the needs of young MSM and MSMW.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Syndemic has become an important theoretical model toward understanding how psychosocial issues may interact to increase HIV acquisition among gay and bisexual men. We measured the extent to which anti-gay experiences are associated with psychosocial issues, which in turn were hypothesized to have an additive effect on HIV risk, in a sample of Canadian young gay and bisexual men. Sixty-eight percent of men reported at least one form of anti-gay experience. For each additional form of anti-gay experience, our data demonstrated increased likelihood of psychosocial issues. Psychosocial issues had an additive effect, increasing the risk of unprotected intercourse in the last 12 months (doubling the risk for those with 3+ issues OR 1.95 [1.39-2.75]). Overall, our findings suggest that a syndemic is occurring among young Canadian gay and bisexual men, highlighting the need to expand HIV prevention efforts beyond sexual risk, to address stigma and gay men's broader health concerns.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - In Vietnam, the co-occurrence (i.e., "syndemic") of psychosocial factors (e.g., depression and substance use) may disproportionately burden male sex workers and increase their HIV risk. A comprehensive survey was conducted among 300 male sex workers in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in 2010. We performed logistic regression to examine the association between the syndemic variable-a count score of the number of five psychosocial conditions endorsed-and unprotected anal sex (UAS) in the past. One-third of participants reported any UAS, and 42 % reported >=2 psychosocial health problems. In multivariable models, experiencing >=4 psychosocial health problems was significantly associated with UAS. Every unit increase in number of psychosocial health problems was associated with a 25-30 % increase in odds of UAS. Understanding the syndemic condition and its association with HIV risk among male sex workers in Vietnam may lead to the development of more effective, comprehensive interventions.

T1  - Condom use self-efficacy and HIV risk practices among men who use the internet to find male partners for unprotected sex.
A1  - Klein, Hugh
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - This research examines the levels of condom use self-efficacy in a population of men who have sex with men who are at great risk for contracting/transmitting HIV. It focuses on the relationship between condom use self-efficacy and risk involvement, and examines the factors associated with greater/lower levels of condom use self-efficacy. The data come from a national sample of men, randomly chosen, who used any of 16 websites specifically to identify other men with whom they could engage in unprotected sex. Data were collected between January 2008 and May 2009 from 332 men, via telephone interviews. Multivariate analyses and structural equation modeling were used to test a conceptual model based on syndemics theory. Overall levels of condom use self-efficacy were fairly high, and self-efficacy was related inversely to involvement in HIV risk practices. Six factors were found to be indicative of levels of condom use self-efficacy: the number of drug problems experienced, sexual role identity as a "bottom," not caring about the HIV serostatus of potential sex partners, experiencing childhood maltreatment, having confidence in HIV-related information provided in other men's online profiles, and level of HIV knowledge. Condom use self-efficacy plays an integral role in HIV risk practices among high-risk men who have sex with men. This is true despite the fact that, overall, condom use self-efficacy levels were fairly high in this population.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Men who have sex with men (MSM) are confronted with different health problems. Next to a higher HIV prevalence and a higher reporting of depressive symptoms and other mental health problems, there is also evidence of substance dependence and sexual compulsivity occurring simultaneously. Using a sample of 591 HIV-negative Belgian MSM, we examine the relationships between depressive symptoms and other risk factors of unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) practice with casual partners. These risk factors include depressive symptoms, sexual behavioural indicators, individual risk perception of UAI, intrapersonal factors measured by the sexual sensation seeking scale, substance use, sources of social support and social norming regarding condom use and finally the location where or media through which men find sex partners. Our findings show that multifactorial, intertwined factors contribute to the explanation of UAI among MSM at risk for HIV infection. These findings underline the need for an integrated sexual health approach for MSM.

N2  - Compared with men who have sex with men only (MSMO), men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) consistently report higher rates of two HIV risk behaviors: transactional sex (TS) and concurrent substance use and sex (CSS). Within MSMW, little is known about how synergistic epidemics ("syndemics") affect TS and CSS. Using a sample of substance-using MSM (n = 515) in South Florida, we compared TS and CSS among MSMO and MSMW; examined whether, within MSMW (n = 86), TS and CSS predict unprotected anal intercourse with partners of serodiscordant/unknown HIV status (SU-UAI); and tested whether syndemics predict TS and CSS. MSMW reported higher rates of engaging in both TS and CSS (AOR = 1.7; 95 % CI 1.0-3.0). Within MSMW, engagement in both TS and CSS predicted SU-UAI (AOR = 3.3; 95 % CI 1.2-9.6); and syndemics predicted TS and CSS involvement (p < 0.01). Substance-using MSMW may benefit from interventions targeting TS, CSS, and background syndemics.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Despite recommendations for generation-based HCV and once lifetime HIV screening, thousands of individuals in the U.S. still remain untested and undiagnosed. This cross-sectional study examines the correlates of HCV and HIV monoinfection and HIV/HCV coinfection in an urban Northeast setting., METHODS: Utilizing an electronic database from a mobile medical clinic in New Haven, CT from January 2003 to July 2011, 8,311 individuals underwent structured health assessment and screening for HIV and HCV., RESULTS: HIV [N = 601 (8.0%)] and HCV [N = 753 (10.1%)] infection were identified, and 197 (26.1%) of the 753 with HCV were coinfected with HIV. Both monoinfection and coinfection status were independently correlated with crack cocaine use and increasing age. HIV/HCV coinfection was correlated with men having sex with men (MSM) (AOR = 38.53, p<0.0080), shooting gallery use (AOR = 3.06, p<0.0070), and not completing high school (AOR = 2.51, p<0.0370). HCV monoinfection correlated with health insurance (AOR = 2.16, p<0.0020), domestic violence (AOR = 1.99, p<0.0070), and being Hispanic (AOR = 2.63, p<0.0001), while HIV monoinfection correlated with having had syphilis (AOR = 2.66, p<0.0001) and being Black (AOR = 1.73, p = 0.0010)., CONCLUSIONS: Though HIV and HCV share common transmission risk behaviors, independent correlates with viral infection status in an urban Northeast setting are distinct and have important implications for surveillance, healthcare delivery, disease prevention, and clinical care.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) have been disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic in the United States and in many other parts of the world. The HIV epidemic is inextricably tied to other health problems that disproportionately affect gay, bisexual, and other MSM including psychological comorbidities, substance use, sexual victimization, stigmatization, and multiple forms of discrimination. These interrelated health problems and social issues can be characterized as a syndemic of mutually reinforcing conditions or epidemics. Moreover, the syndemic is directed by biological, behavioral, psychosocial, and structural determinants. Addressing HIV within the context of a larger syndemic will require a more holistic approach to HIV prevention and treatment that recognizes the interplay between biological, behavioral, psychosocial, and structural factors that affect the health and well-being of sexual minority men.

N2  - The HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa has largely focused on the needs of heterosexual men and women. However, little is known about the sexual risk histories of men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW). Furthermore, we know very little about the psychosocial health needs or of the possibility of a syndemic (numerous interrelated epidemics) among MSMW. We surveyed 1,203 men attending drinking establishments in a township located in Cape Town, South Africa. We compared the behaviors and experiences of MSMW to men reporting only having sex with women (MSW). Twelve percent of the sample reported having sex with both men and women in the past 4 months. MSMW were twice as likely as MSW to report being HIV positive (10.5 vs. 4.6 %). MSW were more likely to be married than MSMW but reported similar numbers of female sex partners. MSMW were more likely to report a history of childhood sexual abuse, recent experienced and perpetrated physical and sexual partner violence, both receiving and giving sex for money, drugs, or shelter, and a recent STI. These factors were found to be interrelated among MSW but not MSMW. Although MSMW demonstrate considerable risk taking and report higher rates of HIV infection than MSW, their needs are largely unmet and underemphasized. Findings suggest the need to better understand factors contributing to sexual risk taking among MSMW. HIV prevention interventions should consider psychosocial health problems unique to MSMW residing in South African townships.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We explored possible correlates of cigarette smoking and their associations with levels of smoking among a sample of Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM). We also explored the syndemic associations of substance use and psychosocial problems on sexual risk behaviors., METHODS: Cross-sectional data collection from 404 MSM in Shanghai, China., RESULTS: MSM exhibit a high prevalence of smoking (66.3%). Both light and heavy smoking were associated with alcohol and drug use, depression, intimate partner violence, sexual attitudes, and gay identity (though the associations for light smokers were moderate compared to those for heavy smokers)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the presence of a health syndemic among MSM, and suggest that smoking prevention and cessation and other substance abuse interventions should be integrated into efforts preventing sexual risk behaviors among MSM.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We tested a theory of syndemic production among men who have sex with men (MSM) using data from a large cohort study., METHODS: Participants were 1551 men from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study enrolled at 4 study sites: Baltimore, Maryland-Washington, DC; Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Participants who attended semiannual visits from April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2009, completed an additional survey that captured data about events throughout their life course thought to be related to syndemic production., RESULTS: Using multivariate analysis, we found that the majority of life-course predictor variables (e.g., victimization, internalized homophobia) were significantly associated with both the syndemic condition and the component psychosocial health outcomes (depressive symptoms, stress, stimulant use, sexual compulsivity, intimate partner violence). A nested negative binomial analysis showed that the overall life course significantly explained variability in the syndemic outcomes (chi(2) = 247.94; P < .001; df = 22)., CONCLUSIONS: We identified life-course events and conditions related to syndemic production that may help to inform innovative interventions that will effectively disentangle interconnecting health problems and promote health among MSM.

N2  - The current study was designed to develop a better understanding of the nature of the relationships between mental health burden, drug use, and unprotected sexual behavior within a sample of emerging adult gay and bisexual men, ages 18-19 (N = 598) and to test a theory of syndemics using structural equation modeling. Participants were actively recruited from community-based settings and the Internet for participation in a seven-wave cohort study. Data for participant characteristics and mental health were collected via computer-assisted survey, while drug use and unprotected sex behaviors for the month prior to assessment were collected via a calendar-based technique. Using the baseline data, we developed and tested structural equation models for mental health burden, drug use, and unprotected sex and also tested a second-order model for a single syndemic. First-order measurement models for each of the three epidemics were successfully identified using observed data. Tests of a second-order model seeking to explain the three epidemics as a single syndemic fit poorly. However, a second-order construct comprised of mental health burden and drug use fit the data well and was highly associated with the first-order construct of unprotected sex. The findings advance a theory of syndemics and suggest that in order to be maximally effective both HIV prevention and HIV care must be delivered holistically such that sexual risk behaviors are addressed in relation to, and in sync with, the drug use and mental health of the individual.

N2  - Serosorting is commonly employed by MSM to reduce HIV risk. We hypothesize that MSM perceive serosorting to be effective, and that serosorting is predicted by resilience and inversely related to syndemic characteristics. Surveys included 504 substance-using MSM. Logistic regression models examined syndemic and resilience predictors of serosorting, separately by serostatus. For HIV-positive men, positive coping behaviors (P = .015) and coping self-efficacy (P = .014) predicted higher odds, and cognitive escape behaviors (P = .003) lower odds, of serosorting. For HIV-negative men, social engagement (P = .03) and coping self-efficacy (P = .01) predicted higher odds, and severe mental distress (P = .001), victimization history (P = .007) and cognitive escape behaviors (P = .006) lower odds, of serosorting. HIV-negative serosorters reported lower perceptions of risk for infection than non-serosorters (P < .000). Although high risk HIV-negative men may perceive serosorting to be effective, their high rates of UAI and partner change render this an ineffective risk reduction approach. Relevant public health messages are urgently needed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The MSM (Men who have sex with men) population suffers from very high rates of concurrent psychosocial problems. Together, these problems comprise a syndemic that increases the risk of HIV infection for this community. The precise mechanisms through which this syndemic can raise the likelihood of HIV infection warrant further exploration., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 522 MSM were enrolled via a multiframe sampling approach and were asked to report psychosocial problems, risky sexual behaviors and HIV test results. A count of psychosocial health problems was calculated to test the additive relationship of these factors on HIV risk. Adjusting analysis and restriction analysis were used to determine a proposed intermediate pathway. Psychosocial health problems are highly concurrent and intercorrelated among urban MSM. Greater numbers of health problems are significantly and positively associated with HIV infection, which is mediated, at least partially, by risky sexual behaviors., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MSM experience concurrent psychosocial health problems that correlate with HIV infection in this community. We recommend the development of coping strategies for this population to deal with these psychosocial problems, both in prevention research and health policy.

N2  - This study analyzed data from a large prospective epidemiologic cohort study among men who have sex with men (MSM), the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, to assess syndemic relationships among black MSM in the cohort (N = 301). We hypothesized that multiple interconnections among psychosocial health conditions would be found among these men, defining syndemic conditions. Constituents of syndemic conditions measured included reported depression symptoms, sexual compulsiveness, substance use, intimate partner violence (IPV), and stress. We found significant evidence of syndemics among these black men: depression symptoms were independently associated with sexual compulsiveness (odds ratios [OR]: 1.88, 95% CI = 1.1, 3.3) and stress (OR: 2.67, 95% CI = 1.5, 4.7); sexual compulsiveness was independently associated with stress (OR: 2.04, 95% CI = 1.2, 3.5); substance misuse was independently associated with IPV (OR: 2.57, 95% CI = 1.4, 4.8); stress independently was associated with depression symptoms (OR: 2.67, 95% CI = 1.5, 4.7), sexual compulsiveness (OR: 2.04, 95% CI = 1.2, 3.5) and IPV (OR: 2.84, 95% CI = 1.6, 4.9). Moreover, men who reported higher numbers of syndemic constituents (three or more conditions) reportedly engaged in more unprotected anal intercourse compared to men who had two or fewer health conditions (OR: 3.46, 95% CI = 1.4-8.3). Findings support the concept of syndemics in black MSM and suggest that syndemic theory may help explain complexities that sustain HIV-related sexual transmission behaviors in this group.

T1  - Sexual compulsivity, co-occurring psychosocial health problems, and HIV risk among gay and bisexual men: further evidence of a syndemic.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether sexual compulsivity fits into a syndemic framework, in which sexual compulsivity is one of a number of co-occurring psychosocial health problems that increase HIV risk among men who have sex with men (MSM)., METHODS: In 2003 and 2004, we conducted an anonymous cross-sectional survey of MSM in New York City (n = 669) by approaching attendees at gay, lesbian, and bisexual community events. We analyzed data by bivariate and multivariate logistic regression., RESULTS: We found strong positive interrelationships among syndemic factors including sexual compulsivity, depression, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and polydrug use. In bivariate analyses, all syndemic health problems except for childhood sexual abuse were positively related to HIV seropositivity and high-risk sexual behavior. Our multivariate models revealed an array of interrelationships among psychosocial health problems. We found amplified effects of these problems on HIV seropositivity and on the likelihood of engaging in high-risk sexual behavior., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the conclusion that sexual compulsivity is a component of a syndemic framework for HIV risk among MSM. HIV prevention interventions should consider the overlapping and compounding effects of psychosocial problems, including sexual compulsivity.

N2  - Using cross-sectional data collected from 1081 Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) recruited with respondent-driven sampling (RDS) techniques from Los Angeles and New York, we examined the extent to which Latino MSM reported exposure to social discrimination (i.e., experienced both homophobia and racism, homophobia only, racism only, or neither homophobia nor racism). More than 40% of respondents experienced both homophobia and racism in the past 12 months. Los Angeles participants, those with lower income, and those who reported being HIV-positive were more likely to report experiencing both types of social discrimination. Adjusting for potential confounders, men exposed to both homophobia and racism were more likely than men exposed to neither form of discrimination to report unprotected receptive anal intercourse with a casual sex partner (AOR = 1.92, 95% CI, 1.18-3.24) and binge drinking (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI, 1.02-1.98). Our findings suggest the presence of a syndemic of adverse social experiences and call for more intervention research to address both homophobia and racism experienced among Latino MSM in the United States.

N2  - Very little information exists with regard to sex party behaviors in young men who have sex with men (YMSM), often defined as men ranging in age from 13 to 29 years. The current analysis examines sex party attendance and behavior in a sample of 540 emergent adult gay, bisexual, and other YMSM in New York City, ages 18-29 years. Findings indicate that 8.7% (n = 47) of the sample had attended a sex party 3 months prior to assessment. Sex party attendees reported that parties included both HIV-positive and HIV-negative men; attendees also reported unprotected sex and limited access to condoms and lubricant. As compared with those who did not attend sex parties, those who did indicated significantly more lifetime and recent (last 3 months) casual sex partners, drug use (both number of different drugs used and total lifetime use), psychosocial burden (history of partner violence and number of arrests), and total syndemic burden (a composite of unprotected anal sex, drug use and psychosocial burden). These results indicate that while only a small percentage of the overall sample attended sex parties, the intersection of both individual risk factors coupled with risk factors engendered within the sex party environment itself has the potential to be a catalyst in the proliferation of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in urban settings. Lastly, given that sex parties are different than other sex environments, commercial and public, with regard to how they are accessed, public health strategies may need to become more tailored in order to reach this potentially highly risky group.

N2  - The prevalence of cigarette smoking among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) is significantly higher than among their heterosexual peers. We undertook an analysis to examine cigarette smoking in relation to demographic factors and other risk behaviors among 580 YMSM, ages 13-29, in New York City. Cross-sectional data were collected as part of larger study of risk behaviors using palm devices and targeted active recruitment strategies across all five boroughs of the city. Multivariate modeling suggests that Asian or Pacific Islander and White YMSM are more likely to report cigarette smoking than other racial and ethnic groups, as are men reporting a middle class socioeconomic status. In addition, smoking was related to the likelihood of using a variety of illicit substances, as well as alcohol and pharmaceuticals without a prescription, during the period of assessment. YMSM who smoke cigarettes reported a greater number of casual sex partners and a greater number of transactional sex partners than non-smokers. Episodic analysis of sexual behaviors with casual partners indicated that smokers were more likely to engage in illicit drug and alcohol use immediately before or during sex than did non-smokers. These findings are understood as part of a larger syndemic among YMSM, and suggest that smoking prevention and cessation programs should be embedded as part of larger more holistic health and wellness programs targeting YMSM.

T1  - Using a syndemics theory approach to study HIV risk taking in a population of men who use the internet to find partners for unprotected sex.
A1  - Klein, Hugh
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - This study examines the value of using syndemics theory as a model for understanding HIV risk taking in a population of men who are at great risk for acquiring and/or transmitting HIV. The principal aim is to provide an empirical test of the applicability of the theory to sexual risk behaviors in this particular research population. The study was based on a national random sample of 332 men who have sex with men, or MSM, who use the Internet to seek men with whom they can engage in unprotected sex. Data collection was conducted via telephone interviews between January 2008 and May 2009. As hypothesized in the syndemics theory model, attitudes toward condom use were central to understanding men's involvement in risky sex. As hypothesized, these attitudes depended on various demographic, psychological/psychosocial functioning, and sex-related preference measures. Also as hypothesized, psychological and psychosocial functioning were found to be very important to the overall model, and as expected, these factors were shaped greatly by factors such as demographic characteristics and childhood maltreatment experiences. The structural equation assessing the fit of the overall model indicated solid support for the syndemics theory approach. Overall, syndemics theory seems to apply fairly well to understanding the complexity of the factors that underlie men's risk-taking practices. The complicated interplay among factors such as attitudes toward condom use, childhood maltreatment experiences, psychological and psychosocial functioning, and substance use and abuse-all of which are central to a syndemics theory approach to studying risk-was demonstrated.

N2  - Health disparities among gay men (HIV, substance use, depression) have been described as a mutually occurring "syndemic" that is socially produced through two overarching dynamics: marginalization and migration. Although the syndemic theory proposes a developmental trajectory, it has been largely based on epidemiological studies of adult gay men and has not been examined using qualitative data from gay male adolescents and emerging adults describing their developmental experience. We conducted interviews with 54 HIV-positive gay and bisexual male adolescents and emerging adults at four sites in the United States. This study provides examples of developmental trajectories that help explain the early onset of socially produced health disparities among some gay male adolescents and emerging adults, but also the development of risk factors that may follow some gay men into adulthood.

N2  - Adopting socioecological, intersectionality, and lifecourse theoretical frameworks may enhance our understanding of the production of syndemic adverse health outcomes among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM). From this perspective, we present preliminary data from three related studies that suggest ways in which social contexts may influence the health of MSM. The first study, using cross-sectional data, looked at migration of MSM to the gay resort area of South Florida, and found that amount of time lived in the area was associated with risk behaviors and HIV infection. The second study, using qualitative interviews, observed complex interactions between neighborhood-level social environments and individual-level racial and sexual identity among MSM in New York City. The third study, using egocentric network analysis with a sample of African American MSM in Baltimore, found that sexual partners were more likely to be found through face-to-face means than the Internet. They also observed that those who co-resided with a sex partner had larger networks of people to depend on for social and financial support, but had the same size sexual networks as those who did not live with a partner. Overall, these findings suggest the need for further investigation into the role of macro-level social forces on the emotional, behavioral, and physical health of urban MSM.

N2  - Men who have sex with men experience high rates of psychosocial health problems such as depression, substance use, and victimization that may be in part the result of adverse life experiences related to cultural marginalization and homophobia. These psychosocial health conditions interact to form a syndemic which may be driving HIV risk within this population. However, MSM also evidence great resilience to both the effects of adversity and the effects of syndemics. Investigating and harnessing these natural strengths and resiliencies may enhance HIV prevention and intervention programs thereby providing the additional effectiveness needed to reverse the trends in HIV infection among MSM.

N2  - Evidence-based HIV prevention interventions with men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States have moderate effect sizes in reducing HIV sexual risk behavior. Mental health and psychosocial problems, which both disproportionately affect MSM populations and are implicated in HIV transmission risk behaviors, also likely interfere with the uptake of HIV behavioral interventions. Moreover, given that mental health and psychosocial problems such as depression, substance use, and violence frequently co-occur for many MSM (eg, as syndemic conditions), what is probably needed are combination prevention efforts, or prevention "cocktails," similar to treatment "cocktails," that address the psychological and behavioral mechanisms that interact to produce elevated risk for HIV. Such interventions should incorporate a holistic framework to address the sexual health and overall well being of MSM. Addressing co-occurring psychosocial risk factors is apt to improve effect sizes of current HIV prevention interventions and allow for more effective uptake by MSM.

T1  - Reframing HIV prevention for gay men in the United States.
A1  - Halkitis, Perry N
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - The HIV epidemic in the United States has affected at least two generations of gay men. Despite numerous efforts to intervene on this public health crisis, HIV infections continue to escalate, especially among young men. This condition is compounded by an ever-growing number of gay men who are aging and living with HIV. We must enact an innovative and proactive vision and framework for HIV prevention that moves us beyond the undertakings rooted in social-cognitive paradigms that have informed this work for the past 25 years. A new framework for HIV prevention must give voice to gay men; must consider the totality of their lives; must delineate the underlying logic, which directs their relation to sex and HIV; and must concurrently respect their diverse life experiences. This approach should be rooted in a biopsychosocial paradigm, should be informed by both theory and practice, and should be directed by three theoretical lenses--a theory of syndemics, developmental theories, and contextual understandings of HIV disease. Taken together, these elements are a call to action for research and practice psychologists who are working to improve the lives of gay men.

T1  - HIV, alcohol, and noninjection drug use.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Alcohol and noninjection drug use has been shown to be associated with increased risk of HIV infection in select populations. In this review, we discuss recent data on the prevalence of alcohol and noninjection drug use and the relationship to HIV acquisition and transmission risk., RECENT FINDINGS: A strong association between alcohol use and HIV-infection risk has been demonstrated in multiple studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Among men who have sex with men in the USA as well as other countries, substance use is highly prevalent and has been associated with high-risk sexual behavior. Substance use, mental health problems, and sexual risk behaviors conjoin in what is known as a syndemic to increase HIV risk among young men who have sex with men. Only a limited number of intervention studies provide promising results in reducing HIV-infection risk among substance users., SUMMARY: Alcohol and noninjection drug use is prevalent in certain populations. There is a strong association between use of alcohol and noninjecting substances, including methamphetamines, amyl nitrates, cocaine, and other drugs, and HIV-infection risk. This underscores the need for a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy that addresses substance use, including screening and behavioral intervention, among those at risk.

T1  - Arrest histories of high-risk gay and bisexual men in Miami: unexpected additional evidence for syndemic theory.
A1  - Kurtz, Steven P
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Gay and bisexual men continue to suffer the highest burden of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. Since the beginning of the epidemic, substance abuse has been shown to be one of the strongest predictors of sexual risk behaviors and seroconversion among this population. Recent research has focused on additional aspects of health risk disparities among gay and bisexual men, including depression and other mental health problems, childhood sexual abuse, and adult victimization, suggesting that these men are impacted by a syndemic of health risks. The involvement of gay and bisexual men with the criminal justice system is largely absent from the literature. This article describes the nature, extent and predictors of the arrest histories of a sample of gay and bisexual substance users at very high risk for HIV infection and/or transmission. These histories are surprisingly extensive, and are strongly associated with poverty, severe mental distress, substance abuse and dependence, and victimization. The involvement of gay and bisexual men in the criminal justice system deserves a stronger research focus because of the unique challenges facing such men and also because arrests are yet another marker for a host of health risks among them.

T1  - Psychosocial health problems increase risk for HIV among urban young men who have sex with men: preliminary evidence of a syndemic in need of attention.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) experience disparities in HIV rates and potentially in mental health, substance abuse, and exposure to violence., PURPOSE: We assessed the extent to which these psychosocial health problems had an additive effect on increasing HIV risk among YMSM., METHODS: An urban sample of 310 ethnically diverse YMSM reported on psychosocial health problems, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV status. A count of psychosocial health problems was calculated to test the additive relationship to HIV risk., RESULTS: The prevalence of psychosocial health problems varied from 23% for regular binge drinking to 34% for experiencing partner violence. Rates of sexual risk behaviors were high and 14% of YMSM reported receiving a HIV+ test result. Psychosocial health problems cooccurred, as evidenced by significant bivariate odds ratios (ORs) between 12 of the 15 associations tested. Number of psychosocial health problems significantly increased the odds of having multiple anal sex partners (OR=1.24), unprotected anal sex (OR=1.42), and an HIV-positive status (OR 1.42), after controlling for demographic factors., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the existence of cooccurring epidemics, or "syndemic," of health problems among YMSM. Disparities exist not only in the prevalence of HIV among YMSM but also in research to combat the epidemic within this vulnerable population. Future research is needed to identify risk and resiliency factors across the range of health disparities and develop interventions that address this syndemic.
